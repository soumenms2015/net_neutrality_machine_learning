Dortch, Secretary\\nFederal Communications Commission\\n445 12th Street SW\\nWashington, DC 20554\\nRe: Open Internet Order Remand Proceeding (GN Dkt. No. 14-28)\\nDear Ms. Dortch:\\nI am writing pursuant to Section 1.1206(b)(2) of the Commission\\u2019s Rules to notify the \\nCommission of two telephone discussions relating to the above-referenced matter.  On Tuesday, \\nMay 6, 2014, on behalf of Cisco Systems, Inc. (\\u201cCisco\\u201d), I spoke with Amy Bender of \\nCommissioner of Commissioner O\\u2019Rielly\\u2019s office.  On Wednesday, May 7, 2014, also on behalf \\nof Cisco, I spoke with Nick Degani of Commissioner Pai\\u2019s office.  \\nDuring the two discussions, I noted that recent decisions made by foreign governments \\nthreaten to undercut innovation and investment in the broadband Internet ecosystem.  These \\ngovernments will be closely watching this proceeding as it unfolds in the United States.  I shared \\nCisco\\u2019s view that the \\u201cspecialized services\\u201d exemption was an extremely important component \\nof the balance struck by Commission\\u2019s 2010 Open Internet Order, and should be retained in any \\nfuture regime.  Further, I urged the Commission not to pursue a constricting definition of \\n\\u201cspecialized services.\\u201d  Rather, in order to accommodate the quickly evolving and still-nascent \\nmarket for managed offerings, the Commission should focus on an approach that promotes the \\ndevelopment and deployment of specialized services that will benefit consumers without \\nimpacting broadband Internet access services.  Finally, I discussed an approach under which \\n\\u201cspecialized services\\u201d might be defined to include any IP-based services that are not broadband \\nInternet access service.  Cisco believes that this approach could be workable so long as it was \\napplied flexibly to accommodate ongoing technological and market developments.\\nRespectfully submitted,\\n/s/ Bryan N.

We join CDT in commending the \\nCommission for its continued focus on the important issue of Internet openness. These brief comments stress \\nfour basic points: \\n \\n\\u2022  the Commission\\u2019s approach to its authority over broadband Internet access is closely related to other \\npriorities; \\n\\u2022  action to protect the open Internet is needed now; \\n\\u2022  nondiscrimination is an essential element of such protection; and \\n\\u2022  the Commission should expressly disclaim authority over Internet content and over-the-top services. \\n \\n1. The Commission\\u2019s approach to its authority over broadband Internet access is crucial not just for \\nthis proceeding, but also for the IP transition and the future relevance of the agency. \\n \\nThe proper scope and source of the Commission\\u2019s authority over broadband Internet access service is important \\nnot just for the specific subject matter addressed in the Open Internet Order, but also more broadly for the IP \\ntransition and the ongoing role of the Commission in the modern communications environment. The \\nCommission should consider the legal authority issue from this broad perspective. \\n \\nWith that in mind, it is perfectly appropriate for the Commission to explore the relatively narrow question of \\nwhether and to what extent it might be able to rely on Section 706 to establish some constraints on online \\nblocking or discrimination in local Internet access networks. But the Commission should also recognize that this \\nissue is best analyzed with an eye to the bigger challenge the agency faces: establishing a clear and stable \\nconception of the agency\\u2019s authority over what is rapidly becoming the core communications network for the \\n21st century and beyond. \\n \\nThe CDT\\u2019s comment points out that the Commission\\u2019s National Broadband Plan recognized we were in the \\nmidst of a \\u201ctransition from a circuit-switched network to a world in which the broadband Internet serves as \\u201ca \\nplatform over which multiple IP-based services \\u2013 including voice, data, and video \\u2013 converge,\\u201d1 and that \\npromoting the transition to an all-IP network is now a significant Commission priority.2   \\n \\nWe would argue that that transition has already taken place for all practical purposes.  The vast majority \\nof my non-confidential communications with clients take place by cell phone, text and email.  Until \\nrecently, I did not text messaging to communicate with clients because it generated no written record of \\nsuch communication.   Now I have cheap software allowing me to dump my phone and preserve test \\nmessages as well as voice messages.  Many of my individual clients do not even have home landlines, \\nincluding almost all of my clients under forty, and if they do have landlines, they are primarily internet-\\n\\n#5;#1;#3;#2;#1;#8;#1;\\nbased, rather than traditional switched-based networks.  My nineteen-year old daughter communicates \\nalmost exclusively with her friends via Facebook and other social media and text, rather than by \\ntelephone or even cell phone.  Most people and businesses of whom and which I am aware conduct the \\nvast majority of their routine business such as banking, shopping, and research online.  My daughter \\ntakes all her news and watches movies by streaming them to her computer.  The vast majority of the \\npopulation who do not stream content to our computers take our news and entertainment from cable \\ntelevision delivered by Comcast, Verizon, or Time-Warner.    \\n \\nAccordingly, we strongly urged the Commission to revisit the regulatory classification of broadband \\nInternet access services and reclassify the same as a telecommunications service, which it clearly is.  \\n \\nThe legal authority questions in this docket cannot reasonably be considered in isolation. At a minimum, while \\nan NPRM may well pose some specific and limited questions about the reach of the agency\\u2019s authority under \\nsection 706, it should be framed in a manner to encourage input on the full range of considerations and options. . \\nGiven the foundational importance of the legal basis for Commission authority over broadband Internet access \\nservices, the Commission also needs to think seriously about the interrelations between this docket, the IP \\ntransition, and the docket on Framework for Broadband Internet Service (GN Docket No. 10-127). Whether the \\nCommission formally links these dockets or not, they raise a crosscutting issue that requires a consistent \\napproach. \\n \\nIn this environment, a stable understanding of the Commission\\u2019s legal jurisdiction over broadband Internet \\naccess services is essential. It is hard to see how the Commission can pursue its mission of encouraging \\u201crapid, \\nefficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service\\u201d3 amidst general uncertainty \\nregarding its authority over the principal element of the emerging communications landscape. \\n \\nIt is far from clear that section 706 can provide an appropriate general legal foundation for Commission \\nauthority in an Internet-based world. As the court in FCC v. Verizon observed, section 706 authorizes only those \\nactions aimed at spurring broadband deployment (and in the case of 706(b), only actions preceded by a finding \\nthat advanced telecommunications are not being deployed to all Americans on a timely basis). It would be an \\nodd result indeed if these parameters were to become the new legal touchstones for the bulk of the \\nCommission\\u2019s work (other than spectrum allocation). It would also make Commission decisions vulnerable to \\nlegal challenges second-guessing the sufficiency of the link between Commission actions and promoting \\nbroadband deployment. \\n \\nWe share CDT\\u2019s view that the Commission\\u2019s authority over Internet matters should be subject to significant \\nlimits, as we have described in prior comments.4  Maximally expansive authority should not be the goal. But \\nappropriately scoped Commission authority is a prerequisite for the Commission pursue any kind of coherent \\npolicy agenda, including the \\u201cNetwork Compact\\u201d vision outlined in recent months by Chairman Wheeler.5 \\n \\n____________________________________________ \\n1\\n Federal Communications Commission, Connecting America: The National Broadband Plan at 59 (Mar. 16, \\n2010), http://www.broadband.gov/plan/. \\n \\n2\\n FCC, Technology Transitions and AT&T Petition Order (GN Docket Nos. 13-5 and 12-353), FCC 14-5, January 30, 2014, \\nhttp://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2014/db0131/FCC-14-5A1.pdf. \\n \\n3\\n 47 U.S.C. 151. \\n \\n4\\n See Comments of CDT in the matter of Framework for Broadband Internet Service (GN Docket No. 10-127), July 15, 2010, \\nhttps://cdt.org/files/pdfs/CDT_Comments-Framework_for_Broadband.pdf, at 2-5; see also Comments of CDT in the matter of Preserving \\nthe Open Internet (GN Docket No. 09-191), Jan. 14, 2010, https://www.cdt.org/files/pdfs/2010_CDT_openness_comments.pdf, at 11-22; \\nReply Comments of CDT in the matter of Preserving the Open Internet (GN Docket No. 09-191), Apr. 26, 2010, \\nhttps://www.cdt.org/files/pdfs/CDT_Reply_Comments-Open_Internet.pdf, at 9-14. \\n \\n5\\n FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, Remarks at the Computer History Museum, January 9, 2014, http://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-\\nchairman-tom-wheeler-remarks-computer-history-museum. \\n\\n#6;#1;#3;#2;#1;#8;#1;\\n2. The Commission should act to protect Internet openness now \\u2013 not wait until non-open practices \\nhave become widespread and entrenched. \\n \\nThe Commission is right to pursue open Internet protections now. Opponents of regulatory action in this area \\noften assert that there have been relatively few examples of broadband providers interfering with Internet traffic. \\nBut setting aside the question of how many examples would be enough to warrant action, it is important to \\nrecognize that for virtually the entire history of this policy debate, regulatory policies and ongoing regulatory \\nproceedings have served as significant constraints on any potential discriminatory behavior by carriers. Consider \\nthe following timeline: \\n \\n\\u2022 Prior to the 2005 Brand X decision and the FCC decision regarding the legal treatment of DSL services \\nlater that same year, broadband services were potentially subject to common carriage obligations. \\n \\n\\u2022  In 2005, the Commission\\u2019s broadband Policy Statement put broadband providers on notice that \\ninterfering with the transmission of lawful online content or services could draw substantial regulatory \\nscrutiny. \\n \\n\\u2022 In 2008, the Commission issued an order reprimanding Comcast for interfering   with some of its \\nsubscribers\\u2019 BitTorrent uploads, thus confirming the Commission\\u2019s intent to police broadband provider \\ninterference with lawful Internet traffic. \\n \\n\\u2022 The Commission\\u2019s action against Comcast was eventually vacated by the D.C. Circuit in Comcast Corp. \\nv. FCC. But by that time, the Commission had already launched in 2009 a rulemaking proceeding to \\nadopt open Internet protections.  Broadband providers would have been well aware that any blocking or \\ndiscrimination during the pendency of this proceeding would have risked a serious policy backlash and \\nundermined their arguments against adopting rules.  \\n \\n\\u2022 The Commission adopted the Open Internet Rules in December 2010. They were not invalidated until \\nJanuary of 2014.  If the Commission were to let this matter drop in the wake of Verizon v. FCC, we \\nwould be in uncharted territory. For the first time, there would be neither an existing policy constraining \\nblocking and discrimination by broadband providers nor a live proceeding aimed at developing such a \\npolicy. Broadband providers would have unprecedented leeway, with little fear of legal or regulatory \\nrepercussions, to try to exercise new measures of influence or control over the content, applications, and \\nservices employed by their subscribers.  The Commission is right to preempt such a dangerous \\nexperiment. If practices to favor or disfavor particular Internet traffic were to become widespread, the \\ndamage to Internet openness could prove difficult or impossible to reverse. Unraveling a web of \\ndiscriminatory deals after significant investments have been made, business plans have been built, and \\ntechnologies have been deployed would be a difficult and complicated undertaking both logistically and \\npolitically. Documenting the harms could prove impracticable; nobody knows about small businesses \\nand innovative applications that are lost before they make it off the ground. Moreover, it is a safe bet \\nthat any future Commission action to roll back perceived harms after they have occurred would meet \\nloud complaints about the unjust nature of ex post facto regulatory action. Broadband providers would \\nsurely say that it is unfair and perhaps illegal for the Commission to interfere with their investment-\\nbacked expectations premised on the current legal environment. \\n \\nTherefore, if we want broadband Internet access services to operate in a manner that preserves the Internet\\u2019s \\nopen character, the most efficient, effective, and fair approach is to establish that expectation in advance. The \\nCommission should address Internet openness in a proactive manner now, rather than kicking the can down the \\nroad. \\n \\n3.  Nondiscrimination is an essential part of a robust open Internet rule. \\n \\nA nondiscrimination principle is an essential component of a framework to protect the Internet\\u2019s open nature. \\n\\n#7;#1;#3;#2;#1;#8;#1;\\nThe Commission could not credibly claim to be fulfilling the goals of the Open Internet Order if it adopted an \\napproach that addressed blocking alone.   \\n \\nAn unconstrained right to discriminate would enable broadband providers to exercise almost as much \\ngatekeeping power as an unconstrained right to block. By degrading some traffic or prioritizing other traffic, \\nbroadband providers could effectively play favorites in the online marketplace, distorting competition among \\nonline content and applications. Innovators and upstarts would need to start worrying about what treatment their \\ntraffic will receive from the broadband providers serving their potential end users.  The more favoritism became \\nwidespread, the more innovators would need to consider striking deals with broadband providers to avoid being \\nplaced at a significant performance disadvantage relative to their competitors. This dynamic is possible even if \\noutright blocking is prohibited; it would be cold comfort to know that broadband providers cannot entirely \\nrefuse to deliver one\\u2019s traffic, if the rules permit them to deliver it at a small fraction of the speed of key rivals.   \\n \\nDiscrimination enables scenarios in which the approval and cooperation of large broadband providers becomes a \\npractical necessity for successful participation in the marketplace for online services. That is the opposite of \\n\\u201cinnovation without permission,\\u201d and it would mean substantially higher entry barriers for online innovation \\u2013 \\nin other words, a less open Internet.  \\n   \\nAs the Commission assesses its potential legal and policy options in this proceeding, it should reject any \\napproach that would fail to include a nondiscrimination principle.  Nondiscrimination is the core of a \\nmeaningful open Internet safeguard. \\n \\n4. The Commission should indicate clearly, from the beginning of this proceeding, that it will not \\nseek to exert jurisdiction over over-the-top online services. \\n \\nAs CDT argued in earlier proceedings concerning the Open Internet Rules, the Commission should narrowly \\nfocus its regulatory activity on broadband Internet access service \\u2013 the physical provision of the transmission \\nlinks that connect subscribers to the Internet. The Commission should expressly disclaim authority over the \\ncontent, applications, and services that run over the Internet.6 \\n \\nFrom a political and public messaging perspective, a clear statement from the Commission that it cannot and \\nwill not pursue higher-layer content regulation would offer the best defense against the all-too-common \\nrhetorical charge that the Commission aims to \\u201cregulate the Internet.\\u201d In the absence of language expressly \\nestablishing limits, opponents of Commission action will continue to argue that the effort to preserve the open \\nInternet may be just the first step in an FCC effort to extend its reach over more and more Internet activity. The \\nCommission can best demonstrate that it harbors no such intent by specifically disclaiming any authority over \\nthe myriad applications and content provided over the Internet. \\n \\nFencing off online content, applications, and services from FCC oversight is also the best approach from a \\npolicy perspective. Without clear limits, open-ended theories and applications of jurisdiction could open the \\ndoor for future Commissions, pursuing any number of potential policy concerns, to attempt to regulate virtually \\nany of the wide range of conduct and communications traversing the Internet. Such a result would undermine \\nInternet openness and thus contravene the policy goals of this proceeding. It also would raise significant legal \\nquestions; communication between Internet endpoints is protected speech and cannot generally be regulated, and \\ncourts have repeatedly struck down efforts to regulate Internet content.7 \\n \\n \\n \\n_______________________________________ \\n6\\n See supra note 4. \\n7\\n See, e.g., Reno v.

Mr. Lieberman explained that Viacom took this punitive step in retaliation for ACA members \\nrefusing to sign cable programming renewal contracts seeking exorbitant fee increases for Viacom \\nnetworks with low ratings and minimal viewer interest.  Mr. Lieberman described how, as a result of \\nthis action, all broadband Internet subscribers of two ACA members \\u2013 Cable ONE and Liberty \\nCablevision of Puerto Rico \\u2013 are being blocked, and that the number of small cable operators \\ntargeted by Viacom is likely to grow since dozens of other ACA members recently chose not to renew \\na cable programming carriage agreement with Viacom. \\n  Mr. Lieberman noted that the Internet has always been a bastion of openness for consumers, \\nwho have been allowed to reach the lawful content of their choice.  Viacom\\u2019s move to block a select \\ngroup of broadband Internet customers regardless of whether they subscribed to the operators\\u2019 video \\nofferings or not is inconsistent with the fundamental tenet of Internet openness that the Commission\\u2019s \\nvacated 2010 Open Internet Order championed.  Mr. Lieberman urged the Commission to seek \\ncomment in its upcoming Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this docket on whether the \\nCommission\\u2019s decision in its 2010 Open Internet Order that the Open Internet rules should not apply \\nto edge provider activities, such as the provision of content or applications over the Internet, remains \\nappropriate given market conditions and recent actions taken by content providers.1\\n                                                \\n1 See In the Matter of Preserving the Open Internet Broadband Industry Practices, Report and Order, GN \\nDocket No. 09-191 and WC Docket 07-52, 25 FCC Rcd 17905, \\u00b6 50 (2010).   \\n\\nACA Ex Parte Letter-GN Docket 14-28 \\nMay 7, 2014 \\nPage 2 \\n_______________\\nIf you have any questions, or require further information, please do not hesitate to contact me \\ndirectly.

This is a key issue for our state. \\nI am writing you to request a delay in tomorrow's scheduled vote on a Notice of Proposed \\nRulemaking (\\\"NPRM\\\") concerning potential regulations of the Internet in light of United States \\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit's recent decision in Verizon v. \\nFCC.I Recent reports indicate that one aspect of your draft rules (Chairman's proposal) to be \\nincluded in the NPRM is the prospect of a so-called ''fast lane\\\" in which larger providers would \\nbe able to charge other entities for preferential handling of their internet traffic, subject to \\ncertain conditions to be imposed by the Commission. I have strong concerns about such an \\napproach and urge you to delay the vote until after the Chairman's proposal is subjected to a \\nmore open examination and comment process before being formalized in an NPRM. \\nWhile I share your conviction that the Internet has become a fundamental instrument in \\naddressing the needs of our nation's economy, educational, scientific and social condition, I also \\nbelieve that you must establish non-discriminatory and well-founded rules to preserve an open \\nInternet. The Internet has become an economic engine generating millions of new jobs while \\nproviding even the smallest businesses in the United States enhanced access to a global \\nmarketplace. I have long contended that it should be the policy of this country - and of the \\ncompanies that do business here - that Internet service providers should have certain duties to \\ntheir customers, including: \\n\\u2022 Not to block, interfere with, discriminate against, impair, or degrade the ability of any person \\nto use an Internet access service to access, use, send, post, receive, or offer any lawful \\ncontent, application, or service through the Internet; \\n\\u2022 Not to impose a charge on any Internet content, service, or application provider to enable any \\nlawful Internet content, application, or service to be offered, provided, or used through the \\nP.O. Box 40002 \\u2022 Olympia, Washington 98504-0002 \\u2022 (360) 902-411 1 \\u2022 www.governor.wa.gov 0 \\n\\nFederal Communications Commission \\nMay 14, 2014 \\nPage2 \\nprovider's service, beyond the end user charges associated with providing the service to such \\nprovider; \\n\\u2022 Not to provide or sell to any content, application, or service provider, including any affiliate \\nprovider or joint venture, any offering that prioritizes traffic over that of other such providers \\non an Internet access service; and \\n\\u2022 Not to install or utilize network features, functions, or capabilities that impede or hinder the \\nduties described above. \\nI believe the Commission's rules should protect users and Internet companies on both fixed and \\nmobile platforms against blocking, discrimination, and paid prioritization, and should make the \\nmarket for Internet services more transparent. The rules should provide certainty to all market \\nparticipants and keep the costs ofregulation low. Such rules are essential for the future of the \\nInternet. However, in light of these concerns, which are shared by many, and because elements \\nof the Chairman's proposal have not been fully aired for all interested parties to have a \\nreasonable chance to comment, I respectfully ask that you delay voting on the proposal until all \\nparties have had a better opportunity to present their views. \\nRespectfully submitted this 14th day of May, 2014. \\ncc:\\u00b7 Commissioner Clyburn \\nCommissioner Rosenworcel \\nCommissioner Pai \\nCommissioner O'Rielly \\nMembers of the Washington State Congressional Delegation\", \n",

I was joined by Cogent's \\nFounder and ChiefExecutive Officer, Dave Schaeffer, Cogent's Chief Legal Officer, Bob Beury, \\nand my partner, Jim Denvir. The Commission staff in attendance included: Tim Brennan, Chief \\nEconomist; Jonathan Chambers, Chief of the Office of Strategic Planning & Policy Analysis; \\nHenning Schulzrinne, Chief Technology Officer; Thomas Spavins, Assistant Chief-Economics, \\nEnforcement Bureau; Julie Veach, Chief of the Wireline Competition Bureau; and Stephanie \\nWeiner, Office ofthe General Counsel. \\nDuring the meeting, Mr. Schaeffer provided an overview of Cogent's business and \\nexplained the role that settlement-free peering among the major networks that, collectively, \\ncomprise the global Internet has played in the Internet's extraordinary growth. Mr. Schaeffer \\nalso described how increasing consumer demand for bandwidth-intensive Internet applications, \\nsuch as streaming video, has led to congestion at various interconnection points between Internet \\nbackbones and certain broadband Internet service providers (\\\"ISPs\\\"). He emphasized that the \\ncapital expenditures required to remedy congestion at interconnection points are extremely \\nmodest. In light ofthis, Mr. Schaeffer observed that the unwillingness of particular ISPs to \\naugment their interconnections with Internet backbones is attributable either to their desire to \\nlimit the competitive vitality oflnternet content that competes with vertically integrated services \\nthey offer (e.g., video or voice) and/or the divergence between the capacity and functionality of \\ntheir own networks as compared to what they marketed and sold to their own customers. \\nAs consumer demand for Internet bandwidth continues to grow, customers of those \\nbroadband ISPs that are unwilling to augment their interconnection with other networks so as to \\nrelieve congestion will, as Mr. Schaeffer explained, be left with an unpalatable choice of \\ncongested service, usage caps and/or increased prices. While some large edge providers may be \\nable to pay a toll to create a way around such congestion, smaller firms will not, thereby driving \\nconsumers to use better performing, vertically integrated content and stifling the investment and \\ninnovation that has been the hallmark of the Internet since its inception. \\nWWW .BSFLLP .COM \\n\\nBOIES, SCHILLER & FLEXNER LLP \\nFor these reasons, Cogent strongly supports reclassification that would permit the \\nCommission to exercise its authority under Title II of the Communications Act to regulate \\nbroadband ISPs as common carriers. \\nPlease direct any questions regarding this matter to my attention. \\ncc: Tim Brennan \\nJonathan Chambers \\nHenning Schulzrinne \\nThomas Spavins \\nJulie Veach \\nStephanie Weiner\", \n",

Polka, President and CEO of the American Cable Association \\n(\\u201cACA\\u201d), had a teleconference with Gigi Sohn, Special Counsel for External Affairs to Chairman \\nWheeler, to discuss recent actions by Viacom to deny access to its websites by broadband Internet \\nsubscribers served by smaller cable broadband providers who are members of ACA.  Mr. Polka \\nexplained that Viacom took this punitive step in retaliation for ACA members refusing to sign cable \\nprogramming renewal contracts seeking exorbitant fee increases for Viacom networks with low \\nratings and minimal viewer interest.  Mr. Polka described how, as a result of this action, all broadband \\nInternet subscribers of two ACA members \\u2013 Cable ONE and Liberty Cablevision of Puerto Rico \\u2013 are \\nbeing blocked, and that the number of small cable operators targeted by Viacom is likely to grow \\nsince dozens of other ACA members recently chose not to renew a cable programming carriage \\nagreement with Viacom. \\n  Mr. Polka noted that the Internet has always been a bastion of openness for consumers, who \\nhave been allowed to reach the lawful content of their choice.  Viacom\\u2019s move to block a select group \\nof broadband Internet customers regardless of whether they subscribed to the operators\\u2019 video \\nofferings or not is inconsistent with the fundamental tenet of Internet openness that the Commission\\u2019s \\nvacated 2010 Open Internet Order championed.  Mr. Polka urged the Commission to seek comment \\nin its upcoming Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this docket on whether the Commission\\u2019s decision \\nin its 2010 Open Internet Order that the Open Internet rules should not apply to edge provider \\nactivities, such as the provision of content or applications over the Internet, remains appropriate given \\nmarket conditions and recent actions taken by content providers.1\\nIf you have any questions, or require further information, please do not hesitate to contact me \\ndirectly.

In \\naddition, Mr. Commisso discussed his views on the issue of\\\"network neutrality.\\\" \\nWith respect to the state of the video marketplace, Mr. Commisso described how \\nconsumers are being harmed because of the absence of effective competitive or regulatory \\nconstraints on wholesale programming costs, including retransmission consent costs. In \\nresponse to questions raised by Commissioner O'Rielly regarding the scope of the Commission's \\nauthority to address the escalating number of retransmission consent b\\u00b7lackouts and the escalating \\nprices demanded by broadcasters for retransmission consent, the Mediacom participants urged \\nthe Commissioner and his staff to take a fresh look at Mediacom's pleadings in the \\nretransmission consent reform proceeding, wherein it has demonstrated persuasively that the \\nCommission not only has the authority to update its retransmission consent rules, but the \\nobligation to do so. Mr. Commisso also reiterated statements made by Mediacom in its \\npleadings in the above referenced-proceedings regarding the various abusive practices, \\nparticularly unjust \\\"volume-based\\\" price discrimination, engaged in by programming suppliers. \\nFinally, Mr. Commisso noted that the proponents of network neutrality regulation seek to \\nprevent Mediacom from asking edge providers to share a fair portion ofMediacom's burden in \\nROSTON \\u2022 CHICt\\\\(>0 \\u2022 FT L.C.lJl>CI{OAI.t \\u2022 Hi\\\\IUFORD \\u2022 LONDON \\u2022 LO~ .l>.I~GtLES \\u2022 .MADI!:>ON Nl \\u2022 NFW YORK \\u2022 H[Wf'ORI llb\\\\CII \\nPROVI[l[I'-IG \\u2022 SINMORD \\u2022 I'OKYO \\u2022 WASHING rON DC \\u2022 W[S I PAlM 111'/\\\\CH \\u2022 HOt-.IG VON<., ;\\\"\\\"'\\\"inlod oflic~>l \\n\\nMs. Marlene H.

(\\u201cCisco\\u201d) and the \\nundersigned met with Diane Cornell and Daniel Alvarez of Chairman Wheeler\\u2019s office to discuss \\nthe above-referenced matter.  \\nDuring the meeting, Cisco noted that recent decisions made by foreign governments \\nthreaten to undercut innovation and investment in the broadband Internet ecosystem.  These \\ngovernments will be closely watching this proceeding as it unfolds in the United States.  Cisco \\nemphasized that the \\u201cspecialized services\\u201d exemption was an extremely important component of \\nthe balance struck by Commission\\u2019s 2010 Open Internet Order, and should be retained in any \\nfuture regime.  Further, Cisco urged the Commission not to pursue a constricting definition of \\n\\u201cspecialized services.\\u201d  Rather, in order to accommodate the quickly evolving and still-nascent \\nmarket for managed offerings, the Commission should focus on an approach that promotes the \\ndevelopment and deployment of specialized services that will benefit consumers without \\nimpacting broadband Internet access services.  Finally, Cisco discussed an approach under which \\n\\u201cspecialized services\\u201d might be defined to include any IP-based services that are not broadband \\nInternet access service.  Cisco stated that this approach could be workable so long as it was \\napplied flexibly to accommodate ongoing technological and market developments.\\nRespectfully submitted,\\n/s/ Bryan N.

We also discussed the issues set fmth in the attached written handout and \\npresentation, which were distributed and discussed at the meeting. The City stressed the \\nimportance of preserving its ability to impose historical preservation, environmental and public \\nsafety conditions on installations and modifications of wireless facilities. \\nIn addition, we discussed issues related to municipal broadband. We informed \\nCommission attendees that since 1995, Texas law has prohibited municipalities from offering \\ntelecommunications and broadband services to the public. \\n\\nMs. Marlene H. Dortch \\nPage2 \\nMarch 11, 2014 \\nIf there are any questions, please feel free to contact the undersigned. \\nAttachments \\ncc: Renee Gregory (Renee.Gregory@fcc.gov) \\nJane Jackson (Jane.Jackson@fcc.gov) \\nPeter Trachtenberg (Peter.Trachtenberg@fcc.gov) \\nGigi Sohn (Gigi.Sohn@fcc.gov) \\n\\n\\n CITY OF SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS \\nFCC DN 13-238 \\nI. San Antonio recognizes the importance of wireless and broadband deployment to its \\nresidents and to economic development.        \\nx The City has granted hundreds of collocation requests in the last three years alone.  \\nx The City has approved the installation of new wireless technologies, such as DAS and \\nsmall cell solutions.  \\nx Subject to building code and other public safety requirements, San Antonio permits \\nboth collocations and new wireless tower siting as of right in industrial and non-\\nhistoric commercial zones in the City.  \\nII. But San Antonio also recognizes that other vital interests\\u2014including historic \\npreservation, environmental concerns, and public safety\\u2014are critical to economic \\ndevelopment, quality of life, and protecting the community\\u2019s cultural heritage.   \\nA. San Antonio is home to over 2000 individual landmarks, 27 different locally \\ndesignated historic districts, and 19 sites on the National Register of Historic \\nPlaces, including the Alamo, the River Walk, and five Spanish Missions, which \\nare  pending designation as a World Heritage site by the United Nations.  \\nx These historic resources contribute significantly to the City\\u2019s tourist trade, \\neconomic growth, and cultural heritage.  \\nx To protect these historic and cultural resources, the City subjects proposed \\nalterations of existing structures in historic districts, river front properties (Rio \\nDistrict), and the Riverwalk area to review and approval.  \\nB. San Antonio\\u2019s primary water source is the Edwards Aquifer \\u2013 a large portion of \\nwhich lies under the City.  A state agency, the Edwards Aquifer Authority, is \\ncharged with regulating and protecting ground water in the Aquifer.  \\nx The City\\u2019s Code complements the Authority\\u2019s mission by imposing \\nconditions on any \\u201cdevelopment\\u201d over the Aquifer Recharge Zone to prevent \\ndegradation of surface water over the Aquifer.  \\n\\n 2 \\n \\nx For wireless infrastructure over the Aquifer Recharge Zone, that would \\ninclude conditions to prevent leakage from fuel tanks, batteries or generators.  \\nC. San Antonio protects public safety with reasonable limitations on tower heights \\nand set backs, while working with the wireless industry to accommodate tower \\ndeployment throughout the community. \\nx The City Code restricts tower heights in areas around two San Antonio \\nairports and several federal military installations consistent with federal law. \\nx The City Code requires set backs for wireless towers in and adjacent to \\nresidential zones to protect residential areas from potential personal injury and \\nproperty damage resulting from a falling tower.  The City also requires \\nstructural safety analysis for all collocations. \\nx The City also leases City-owned property for tower siting and collocation in \\nall zones, including residential zones.  This win-win policy allows wireless \\nfacilities to penetrate residential zones in a less intrusive manner. \\nIII. The FCC should not, and need not, construe Section 6409(a) to inhibit San Antonio\\u2019s \\nability to impose historic preservation, environmental protection or public safety \\nconditions on wireless siting projects, or to give the wireless industry free access to City-\\nowned property.           \\nA. An eligible facilities request that does not comply with a locality\\u2019s generally \\napplicable historic preservation, environmental protection or public safety \\nrequirements is a \\u201csubstantial change.\\u201d \\nB. Conditioning approval of an eligible facilities request on compliance with a \\nlocality\\u2019s generally applicable historic preservation, environmental protection or \\npublic safety requirements is consistent with Section 6409(a)\\u2019s \\u201cshall approve\\u201d \\nlanguage.  \\nC. Access to City-owned property is outside the scope and reach of Section 6409(a). \\nIV. San Antonio\\u2019s balancing process has worked well\\u2014it has promoted widespread wireless \\nand broadband deployment while, at the same time, protecting public safety, historic and \\ncultural resources, and environmentally sensitive areas.  The FCC should not disturb that \\nbalance.            \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSan Antonio Recognizes the Importance of \\nWireless and Broadband Deployment \\n\\u2022 The City has granted lOOs of collocation requests \\nin the last 3 years, alone \\n\\u2022 The City has approved the installation of DAS and \\nsmall cells \\n\\u2022 The City leases City-owned property for tower \\nsiting and collocation in all zones, including \\nresidential zones \\n\\u2022 Subject to building code and other public safety \\nrequirements, the City permits new wireless \\nfacilities and collocations as of right in industrial \\nand non-historic commercial zones \\n2 \\n\\nRich Historic Resources \\n\\u2022 Including-\\n- Over 2000 individual landmarks \\n- 27 different locally designated historic districts \\n- 19 sites on the National Register of Historic Places \\n- Designation of 5 historic missions as UNESCO World \\nHeritage Sites pending \\n\\u2022 San Antonio is a popular tourist destination with \\nover 28 million visitors each year \\n\\u2022 City subjects alterations (including wireless \\nfacilities) in historic and riverfront areas to review \\nand approval \\n3 \\n\\n\\n\\nSan Antonio River Walk \\nThe elevator in the background is the location of a small cell tower, approved through the \\n5 \\nCity's review process. \\n\\nQJ \\n!a.... \\n. \\n+-' \\nu \\n\\u00b7;:: \\n+-' \\nVl \\n\\u00b7-\\nro \\n:J \\n\\\"'C \\nu \\n\\u00b7;:: \\n0 \\n+-' \\nc-\\nV) \\nVl \\n\\u00b7-\\n-\\n..c \\n:J ro \\n\\u00b7-u \\n!o.... \\nQJ \\nE \\nro \\nE \\na.. \\n\\u2022 0 u \\n<t: \\n......, \\nV) \\n\\n-ro $ \\n!I.-\\nOJ \\n> \\n\\u00b7-0::: \\n\\nc \\n0 \\n\\u00b7-u \\nc.. \\nQ) \\nu \\nc \\n0 \\nu \\nc \\n0 \\n\\u00b7-Vl \\nVl \\n\\u00b7-\\n\\nHomes in Primarily \\nResidential Historic \\nDistricts \\nHistoric districts are \\ntypically created \\nthrough a public \\nprocess and result from \\na great community \\neffort to protect an \\narea. \\n\\nEnvironmental and Public Safety Concerns \\n\\u2022 Edwards Aquifer: the City's primary water \\nsource \\n- Edwards Aquifer Authority (Texas agency) \\n-San Antonio City Code--imposes conditions on all \\ndevelopments in Aquifer Recharge Zone to \\nprevent leakage into Aquifer \\n\\u2022 Tower heights, set backs, and safety analyses \\nprotect persons and property from potential \\ninjury and damage from a falling tower \\n10 \\n\\nEdwards Aqu \\nRecharge Zone \\nCity ..

AND \\nGOLDEN FROG, INC. \\n Data Foundry, Inc., Giganews, Inc. and Golden Frog, Inc. (the Companies) submit these \\nbrief Preliminary Comments in response to the invitation expressed in the February 19, 2014 \\nPublic Notice, DA 14-211, that announced the opening of this Docket and requesting input \\nwithin 30 days. The PN sought suggestions on \\u201cwhat actions the Commission should take, \\nconsistent with our authority under section 706 and all other available sources of Commission \\nauthority, in light of the court\\u2019s decision.\\u201d \\nThere is little to no competition for broadband transmission facilities used to offer service \\nto the public. In most places there are only one or two \\u201cwireline\\u201d broadband providers. The cost \\nof constructing duplicative ubiquitous facilities poses high economic and regulatory barriers to \\nnew entry. \\nA mistaken change in regulatory policy beginning in 1998 allowed cable and then fiber \\ntransmission providers to bundle transmission and higher-layer functions into a single product \\nand thereby escape regulation. This led inexorably to the removal of telephone company \\ntransmission as a reasonably-available, stand-alone service or facility. As a result, the dominant \\nproviders have been able to leverage their market power over the \\u201ctransmission\\u201d market into the \\nlogically separate and adjacent \\u201cInternet access\\u201d market. They then have the incentive to block, \\ndegrade, discriminate or control prices for access to and use of unaffiliated applications, services \\nand content sources on the Internet as a means to extract monopoly rents from both markets. \\n\\nPage -2-\\nThe FCC\\u2019s last effort (Net Neutrality) suffered from three defects. First, it was premised \\non an acceptance of duopoly conditions and exclusive bundling. \\u201cNet Neutrality\\u201d merely tried to \\nameliorate some of the downside effects. Second, it created unintended problems. Among other \\nthings, it functionally required the broadband provider to inspect content and determine what \\napplication was being used in order to implement the nondiscrimination and no blocking \\nmandates. Finally, as held by the D.C. Circuit, it does not comport with the Communications \\nAct. \\n\\u201cNet Neutrality\\u201d is not \\u201cOpen Internet.\\u201d The FCC must admit the errors committed by \\npast administrations and reinstate Computer Inquiry and 251(c) \\u201cOpen Access\\u201d unbundling and \\ninterconnection rules on ILECs, as well as their functional equivalent in broadband, the cable \\noperators. \\nOpen Access was in place for over 20 years and led to the creation of a vibrant and \\ncompetitive market in long distance, enhanced/information services, and end-user CPE. Without \\nOpen Access, the Internet would have not emerged and thrived. The FCC\\u2019s serial decisions to \\nclose off access to the local network by independent Internet providers is what caused us to be in \\nthe situtation we are today. The FCC (and the states in tandem) should return to the previously-\\nsuccessful policy of requiring dominant transmission facilities owners to offer stand-alone raw \\ntransmission on a common carrier basis, and to allow end users to use competitively available \\ncustomer premises equipment that will connect to the broadband networks of alternative Internet \\naccess providers. Regulators should (1) re-institute the Computer Inquiry regime of service and \\nfacility unbundled transmission for all facility based providers; (2) engage in a \\u00a7251(h) \\nproceeding to decide whether cable companies\\u2019 operations should be treated as incumbent local \\n\\nPage -3-\\nexchange carriers; and (3) reconsider whether broadband transmission links should be brought \\nback into the \\u00a7251(c)(3) UNE regime. \\nThe current discussion suggests that the FCC may impose common carrier regulation on \\n\\u201cInternet access.\\u201d This is a mistake, for several legal and technical reasons. Internet access can \\nbe competitive, and does not need to be regulated. Transmission is the bottleneck and that is \\nwhat must be returned to Title II treatment. The entire purpose of Computer Inquiry and the 1996 \\namendments was to isolate the essential transmission (i.e., \\u201ctelecommunications\\u201d) building \\nblocks and regulate them, while deregulating potentially competitive services that rely on \\ntransmission. The FCC does not need to regulate \\u201cthe Internet\\u201d; it just needs to reinstitute the \\nOpen Access rules that prevailed for more than 20 years. \\nRespectfully Submitted, \\n  /s/ Matthew A.

Sohn, Chairman Wheeler\\u2019s Special Counsel for External Affairs; and Diane \\nCornell, Special Counsel to the Chairman.  This presentation during the Sunshine period was \\n\\u201crequested by\\u201d the Chairman \\u201cfor the clarification or adduction of evidence.\\u201d  See 47 C.F.R. \\n\\u00a7 1.1204(a)(10)(iv).  The presentation was thus exempt from the Sunshine period prohibition, \\npursuant to Section 1.1203(a)(1) of the Commission\\u2019s rules.  We file this notice today in \\naccordance with Section 1.1206(b)(2)(v).  \\n \\nThe company representatives and Open Internet advocates in attendance were Althea \\nErickson, for Etsy; Marvin Ammori, on behalf of Engine Advocacy; Gabriel Rottman, of the \\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union; Steven Renderos, of the Media Action Grassroots Network; \\nRachel Colyer, of Daily Kos; David Segal, of Demand Progress; and Craig Aaron and Matt \\nWood, of Free Press. \\n \\nDuring the meeting, we expressed our collective users\\u2019 and members\\u2019 views regarding \\nthe importance an Open Internet, as well as their concerns about the Chairman\\u2019s current proposal \\nto protect it.  For example, more than one million Etsy users rely on that company\\u2019s site to sell \\ntheir products and power their small businesses.  These individual sellers could not hope to \\nexpand their presence online, or to compete against larger businesses and content providers, if \\nISPs could charge new tolls and access fees for reaching their broadband customers.  Startups \\nand other innovative companies need the Open Internet to thrive, and have neither the legal \\nteams nor the resources to negotiate individually with \\u2013 or litigate against \\u2013 every ISP in the \\ncountry. \\n \\n\\n 2 \\nEdge companies cannot afford the complex, multi-factor, innovation-with-permission \\nframework that would take hold were the FCC to adopt a \\u201ccommercially reasonable\\u201d standard \\nrather than an enforceable, bright-line rule against blocking and discrimination. \\n \\n Typically marginalized and underserved communities cannot afford to deal with such \\ndiscrimination either.  The individuals who live in these communities, and the grassroots groups \\nthat work in them, rely on an Open Internet to tell their own stories and, oftentimes, dissent in \\nways that traditional broadcast media do not allow. \\n \\nHundreds of people protested at the Commission in advance of the May 15 vote, \\nthousands more called, and millions more wrote, signed petitions, and filed comments with the \\nagency.  People understand the importance of this issue, and they are ready to tell the \\nCommission about it.  Representatives of the membership organizations in attendance described \\nthe importance of an Open Internet for their advocacy and organizing efforts on these \\ncommunications policy topics \\u2013 and its importance too for all of the other social justice, civil \\nliberties, electoral transparency and civic responsibility topics they work on as well.  They \\ndiscussed the chilling effect on speech from increased consolidation of power in the hands of a \\nfew media conglomerates and dominant broadband providers. \\n \\n In sum, the companies and organizations at today\\u2019s meeting articulated the importance of \\nthe Open Internet to our democracy and our economy.  We described the detrimental impact on \\ninnovation and free expression that would result from permitting broadband ISPs to interfere \\nwith communications they should carry indiscriminately.  We expressed our desire to work with \\nthe Chairman and the Commission as they undertake this proceeding and fulfill the promises \\nmade by it.  But we made clear our position that nothing short of real Net Neutrality will suffice \\nto keep the Internet the vital platform it has become for commerce and activism, with its unique \\nability to empower new ventures and raise new voices. \\n \\n \\nRespectfully submitted, \\n \\n /s/ Matthew F.

In addition, Mr. Commisso discussed his views on the issue \\nof\\\"network neutrality.\\\" \\nWith respect to the state of the video marketplace, Mr. Commisso described how \\nconsumers are being harmed because of the absence of effective competitive or regulatory \\nconstraints on wholesale programming costs, including retransmission consent costs. The \\nMediacom participants urged Commissioner Clyburn to take a fresh look at Mediacom's \\npleadings in the retransmission consent reform proceeding, wherein it has demonstrated \\npersuasively that the Commission not only has the authority to update its retransmission consent \\nrules, but the obligation to do so. Mr. Commisso also reiterated statements previously made by \\nMediacom in its pleadings in the above-referenced proceedings regarding the various abusive \\npractices engaged in by programming suppliers, particularly unjust \\\"volume-based\\\" price \\ndiscrimination. \\nFinally, Mr. Commisso noted that proponents of network neutrality regulation seek to \\nprevent Mediacom from asking edge providers to share a fair portion of Mediacom's burden in \\noperating and upgrading its facilities to handle the volume of traffic created by those edge \\nproviders. As Mr. Commisso pointed out, when \\\"network neutrality'' regulation is discussed, \\nlittle or no consideration is given to the fact that if edge providers- particularly the large edge \\nf\\\\OSTON \\u2022 CHoCAC30 \\u2022 ~I lf\\\\IJI)fRI)Aif. \\u2022 IIARlf-OP.D \\u2022 LONLJOI'I \\u2022 LOS Ar-J(;f.L'ES \\u2022 MADISON NJ \\u2022 N~'.tl YO~K \\u2022 NF'NPORT BEA(II \\nPROVIDENCE \\u2022 $ 1.1>.Mf1)~0 \\u2022 f()I(Y() \\u2022 li\\u00b7/ASHit-.tGTC'N DC \\u2022 Wl;$1 PAlf.lo f\\\\FACH \\u2022 l-ION(; KONG l'lHeo<\\u00b7i(lted oflic\\u2022,) \\n\\nMs. Marlene H.

        "  \"text\": \"Title II - Independent Colleges & Universities of Texas \\n \\nI am writing on behalf of the Independent Colleges & Universities of Texas, Incorporated \\n(ICUT).   Our association, based in Austin, Texas represents 41 four-year colleges and \\nUniversities enrolling approximately 123,300 students throughout the state. \\nICUT is opposed to reclassifying the Internet from a Title I information service to a Title II \\ncommunications service. \\nOur reasoning follows: \\nTexas is blessed with a wide variety of public and private institutions of higher learning. From \\ninternationally recognized schools like the University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M, to \\nsmaller, more focused colleges, like Wiley College, a traditionally Black college founded in \\n1873, Texas presents both in- and out-of-state; as well as domestic and international, students \\nwith a vast variety of educational opportunities.   \\nBased in Austin as ICUT is, we are keenly aware of the continuing developments in the Internet \\neco-system. For many years there were non-stop flights between Austin and San Jose, California, \\nto cross feed the burgeoning Internet economy from its earliest years. \\nBecause of that many associations based here have learned to utilize the Internet \\u2013 and especially \\nbroadband access to the Internet \\u2013 in new and exciting ways that benefit not just the institutions \\nand their students but, by extension, society as a whole.  \\nBecause of the geographic size of Texas (it is a longer distance from El Paso in the west to Port \\nArthur in the east than either of those cities are to the Pacific or Atlantic Oceans respectively) the \\nchallenges of bringing broadband service to all corners of the state are huge. Add to that, the \\npopulation, estimated at 26.5 million in 2013 by the U.S. Census Bureau, and the scope of the \\nissue becomes clear. \\nNot only that, but the population is not evenly distributed across the state. Because of Texas\\u2019 \\nunique desire to make local government available to all, there are 254 counties ranging in size \\nfrom massive Harris County (Houston metropolitan area) with a population of 4.4 million to tiny \\nLoving County (West Texas) whose population is 82.  \\nModern broadband access to the Internet presents a pathway in both directions that simply did \\nnot exist prior to the adoption of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. When the Internet was \\nopened to private investment and development, its advantages became available not just to our \\nmajor member academic institutions like Baylor and Rice Universities, but to our smallest \\ncolleges as well. \\nPrior to 2000 having a broadband connection might not just have required admittance to a major \\nuniversity; but might well have required a key to the physics or math building as well as booking \\n\\ntime to be able to utilize it.  Most of our member institutions could no more afford a high-speed \\nInternet connection in 1998 than they could field a Division I football or basketball team. \\nToday, less than a decade-and-a-half later, broadband is considered by students, faculty and staff \\nto be the equivalent of water, or electricity: Widely available, highly dependable, easily to \\naccessed and use. \\nThat astonishing level of development is the direct result of the more than $1.2 trillion invested \\nby stakeholders in the Internet ecosystem. That investment, in our opinion, was further driven by \\na unique understanding between the Federal Communications Commission and major Internet \\nproviders that allowed that growth to flourish in an atmosphere of what has been called a \\u201clight \\ntouch\\u201d regulatory environment. \\nMany of our member institutions are in large and mid-sized counties and have the infrastructure \\nadvantages that population brings. Others, like Wiley College (located about mid-way between \\nLongview, Texas and Shreveport, Louisiana) have a more difficult time securing some of those \\nsame advantages. \\nA central focus of an organization like ICUT is helping our member institutions utilize the tools \\nthat are available to them to bring the highest levels of the educational experience to the \\ncampuses, but also to help our schools reach out and bring that same experience to those students \\nwho cannot be full- or even part-time on-campus students. \\nDistance learning, according to the California Distance Learning Project (www.cdlponline.org)  \\ntraces its roots in America to \\u201c1874 at Illinois Wesleyan University where bachelor and graduate \\ndegrees could be obtained in absentia. The Chautauqua movement in about 1882 gave the \\npopular push to correspondence education.\\u201d \\nIn 1922, Penn State University began experimenting with the use of radio as its channel to reach \\noff-campus students. In 1968 Stanford University began using television to teach engineering \\ncourses.  By 2003, 81 percent of colleges were offering at least one on-line course and by 2012, \\ntwo million students took all of their courses on-line (http://www.straighterline.com ). \\nThroughout the modern history of American education, colleges and universities have utilized \\nthe latest technology in their continuing quest to bring quality education to the widest possible \\naudience. \\nIt is the firm belief of the ICUT that this kind of innovation has traditionally, and will continue, \\nto be driven by the educational marketplace \\u2013 whether through state-sponsored public schools, or \\nindependent colleges and universities like our members. \\nThe Internet allows information to pass in both directions from student to teacher and from \\ncampus to home allowing those who are working, have families, or live too far away to attend \\nclasses regularly to have the same educational opportunities as their more fortunate classmates.   \\nFor institutions of higher learning the Internet is the quintessential \\u201cinformation service\\u201d and \\nshould be allowed to continue as a Title I service, so that America\\u2019s colleges and universities can \\n\\ncontinue to develop new courseware, and new techniques that allow all Americans the \\nopportunity to reach their educational goals. \\n \\n--------------------\", \n",

The PaPUC, however, maintains that modified common carriage is \\nnecessary so that all providers seeking to deliver services over the PSTN, albeit a \\nPublic Switched Transportation Network or a Packet Sending Transmission \\nNetwork, will be shouldering an appropriate portion of the total FUSF [federal \\nuniversal service fund or FUSF] and, now, network access. \\nThe PaPUC suggested then, and repeats today, that a modified form of \\ncommon carriage might well be the most effective, if not the only, way of \\nproviding open access to all facilities and ensuring support for whatever programs \\nthe FCC decides to support from the FUSF.  This may well come to include \\nbroadband deployment and/or support for broadband services under the National \\nBroadband Plan or its successors. \\n* * * \\nThe PaPUC is gravely concerned, and could not support, a result in which \\nthe FCC preempts the states or reaches a forbearance decision that leaves the \\nstates with no viable role.  An FCC decision that reclassifies the \\u201cbroadband \\ninterconnectivity service\\u201d as \\u201ctelecommunications\\u201d or \\u201ctelecommunications \\nservice\\u201d must respect state law. \\n* * * \\nFinally, a modified common carriage approach that retains state authority \\nbetter reconciles the FCC\\u2019s preservation of federal authority to ensure open access \\nwith state jurisdiction.  Of necessity, moreover, a federal solution that preserves \\nstate authority must address the difficult questions of consumer protections and \\nfederal support for state work on federal goals, particularly the difficult issue of \\nauthorizing the states to impose a modest assessment on interstate revenues in \\nsupport of federal efforts. \\nPa. PUC Initial Comments, Appendix A (Pa. PUC Comments, In re Framework for Broadband \\nInternet Service, et al., GN Docket No. 10-127 et al., submitted July 15, 2010), at 3-4, 6 \\n(footnotes omitted). \\n These Pa. PUC positions are fully consistent with the FCC\\u2019s reliance on Sec. 706, 47 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 1301 et seq., authority in promulgating its contemplated regulatory methods through its \\nOpen Internet NPRM.4  This is because Sec. 706(a), 47 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1302(a), clearly specifies a dual \\nrole for both the \\u201cCommission and each State commission with regulatory jurisdiction over \\n4 Open Internet NPRM, \\u00b6 143, at 50. \\n\\nComments of the Pa.

For example, in 1993 and, \\nagain, in 2004, Pennsylvania aggressively advanced the deployment of broadband networks by \\nincumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) through a statutorily prescribed incentive system of \\nregulation that includes the use of price cap mechanisms.5\\nFurthermore, the statutory term \\u201cadvanced telecommunications capability\\u201d in Sec. \\n706(c)(1), 47 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1302(d)(1), \\u201cis defined, without regard to any transmission media or \\ntechnology, as high-speed, switched, broadband telecommunications capability that enables users \\nto originate and receive high-quality voice, data, graphics, and video telecommunications using \\nany technology.\\u201d  47 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1302(d)(1).  Thus, the statutory connotation that the \\u201cadvanced \\ntelecommunications capability\\u201d is or should be treated as \\u201ctelecommunications\\u201d or \\u201ctelecommu-\\nnications service\\u201d under a dual federal and state involvement is rather strong. \\nB. The Commission\\u2019s Regulatory Methods In Protecting And Promoting An Open \\nInternet Require Consistency \\nThe formulation, adoption, and implementation of the regulatory methods that the \\nCommission contemplates in protecting and promoting an open Internet in its NPRM require \\nconsistency.  The broadband access services at issue6 rely upon physical networks.  The capacity \\nof such wireline and wireless physical networks is utilized by the traffic demand of multiple \\ntypes, classifications, and protocols.  Such capacity utilization, of course, imposes economic \\ncosts on the relevant physical networks especially when and where retail and wholesale \\nbroadband access demand and related physical facilities are concerned.  These physical network \\nfacilities are required to handle such traffic demand irrespective of the underlying traffic types, \\nclassifications, and protocols. Indeed, physical network access facilities, e.g., fiber optic cables \\nare agnostic on whether they handle ordinary voice call traffic or the transmission and delivery \\n5 See generally 66 Pa. C.S. \\u00a7 3011 et seq. \\n6 Services that provide the desired Sec. 706(c)(1) \\u201cadvanced telecommunications capability.\\u201d \\n\\nComments of the Pa. PUC \\nDocket No. GN 14-28 \\nJuly 15, 2014 \\n4\\nof Internet Protocol based packetized videos. Naturally, the operators of these facilities are \\nentitled to recover the relevant economic costs of their respective physical networks so that they \\ncan continue to make appropriate capital investments with new and innovative technologies in \\norder to meet the growing and universal demand for retail and wholesale broadband access \\nservices across America. \\nThe Commission appears to recognize this fact because its NPRM \\u201cdoes not preclude \\nbroadband providers from negotiating individualized differentiated arrangements with similarly \\nsituated edge providers (subject to the separate commercial reasonableness rule or its \\nequivalent)\\u201d so long as \\u201cbroadband providers do not degrade lawful content or service below a \\nminimum level of access.\\u201d7  Indeed, when and where traffic demand \\u2014 irrespective of the traffic \\ntypes, classifications, and protocols \\u2014 imposes economic costs on the capacity of physical \\naccess networks, such costs need to be recovered.  For example, the NPRM appears to correctly \\nacknowledge that the utilization of physical network access capacity by Internet-based traffic \\ndemand imposes economic costs on the networks and on the relevant retail and wholesale \\nbroadband access services. \\nThe Pa. PUC encourages the Commission to address these issues in a consistent fashion.  \\nThe Commission\\u2019s laudable goals in protecting and promoting the open Internet in accordance \\nwith the statutory premises of Sec. 706 are not divorced from the redefined concept of universal \\nservice and broadband deployment that the FCC addressed in its USF/ICC Transformation Order\\nand continues to implement.  The Pa. PUC believes that its modified common carriage proposals \\nprovide the basis for the consistent formulation and implementation of standards that would not \\nonly protect the open Internet but would continue to provide the appropriate economic incentives \\nfor the continuous deployment of broadband access network facilities and services throughout \\nthe United States with the appropriate support from the federal and state USF mechanisms.  The \\nPa. PUC also encourages the Commission to fully utilize the statutory premise of Sec. 706 in this \\nendeavor by seeking and obtaining the appropriate and active cooperation of the states and of the \\nstatutorily created Federal-State Joint Boards. \\nRespectfully Submitted, \\n/s/  David E.

(\\u201cCisco\\u201d), as well as Bryan Tramont and the undersigned, both of Wilkinson \\nBarker Knauer, LLP, met with Jonathan Sallet, Henning Schulzrinne, and Claude Aiken of the \\nOffice of General Counsel and Matthew DelNero of the Wireline Competition Bureau to discuss \\nthe above-referenced matter.  \\nDuring the meeting, Cisco noted that recent decisions made by foreign governments \\nthreaten to undercut innovation and investment in the broadband Internet ecosystem.  These \\ngovernments will be closely watching this proceeding as it unfolds in the United States.  Cisco \\nemphasized that the \\u201cspecialized services\\u201d exemption was an extremely important component of \\nthe balance struck by Commission\\u2019s 2010 Open Internet Order, and should be retained in any \\nfuture regime.  Further, Cisco urged the Commission not to pursue a constricting definition of \\n\\u201cspecialized services.\\u201d  Rather, in order to accommodate the quickly evolving and still-nascent \\nmarket for managed offerings, the Commission should focus on an approach that promotes the \\ndevelopment and deployment of specialized services that will benefit consumers without \\nimpacting broadband Internet access services.  Finally, Cisco discussed a proposal raised by staff \\nduring the meeting that \\u201cspecialized services\\u201d might be defined to include any IP-based services \\nthat are not broadband Internet access service.  Cisco stated that this approach could be workable \\nso long as it was applied flexibly to accommodate ongoing technological and market\\ndevelopments.\\n\\nMarlene H.

Benton has long advocated for ubiquitous \\ntelecommunications access for all citizens. \\nThe Benton Foundation welcomes the Commission\\u2019s renewed resolve to protect the Open \\nInternet after the recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \\nCircuit (D.C. Circuit) striking down the Commission\\u2019s Open Internet Order. Open Internet rules \\nare necessary for the Internet to continue to be a boon to commerce and our democracy, and they \\nremain an important policy goal of the Commission. However, the Commission\\u2019s current \\nproposal to adopt new rules using its Section 706 authority is problematic for several reasons\\ndiscussed in these comments. Instead, the Commission should strongly consider the merits of \\nprotecting the Open Internet through Title II reclassification.\\nI. Preserving the Open Internet remains an important and vital policy goal\\nThe Commission originally identified preserving the Open Internet as an important policy \\ngoal nine years ago. In its 2005 Policy Statement, the Commission adopted a policy ensuring \\nconsumer access to online content and devices. After the D.C. Circuit struck down the \\nCommission\\u2019s attempt to enforce the policy statement in Comcast v. FCC,3 the Commission \\nadopted a rule protecting the Open Internet in 2010. The resulting Order, among other things,\\nprevented Internet Service Providers (ISPs), such as Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T, from \\nblocking and discriminating against specific content that travels over their networks.4 The Order \\nalso discussed at length ISPs\\u2019 perverse incentives to block, degrade, or otherwise harm Internet \\ncontent, especially third-party services that compete with services the ISP also offers.5 Despite \\nthese harmful incentives and a discussion of specific instances of problematic behavior,6 critics \\n3 600 F.3d 642 (D.C. Cir. 2010).\\n4 Preserving the Open Internet, Report and Order, 25 FCC Rcd 17905 (2010) (\\u201cOrder\\u201d).\\n5 Id. at 17915-25.\\n6 Id. at 17925-27.\\n\\n3of the rule still decried it as a solution in search of a problem.7 The D.C. Circuit did not see it \\nthat way: it properly accepted the argument that there is a true need for Open Internet regulation \\nbased on the Commission\\u2019s findings and expertise in this area.8\\nThe policy goal of preventing content discrimination remains just as important today as it \\nwas in 2005 and 2010, especially because harmful ISP incentives and behavior continue to \\nplague the Internet ecosystem. At the Verizon v. FCC oral argument, Verizon admitted it would \\nlike to enter into arrangements allowing it to discriminate based on content or content provider.\\nConsistent with this admission, consumers accused Verizon of throttling Netflix and Amazon \\nshortly after the Verizon decision.9 Even though concrete evidence of these allegations did not \\nsurface, that is partially due to the lack of transparency into ISPs\\u2019 specific equipment \\nconfiguration and the inability to precisely determine the cause of slow Internet speeds.\\nIt is particularly important to enact strong Open Internet rules because of the \\ndisproportionate impact of an ISP\\u2019s discriminatory behavior on vulnerable populations, such as \\npeople of color, low-income populations, seniors, people with disabilities, and rural \\ncommunities.  These groups of traditionally-marginalized voices rely on the Internet as a \\ncritical\\u2014and unique\\u2014tool for communication and empowerment.  The Internet provides a \\nmeans for these communities to dispel misperceptions and stereotypes that restrict their political, \\n7 E.g., Daniel Brenner, Net Neutrality: A Solution in Search of a Problem, Forbes (Sept. 25, \\n2012), http://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2012/09/25/net-neutrality-a-solution-in-search-of-\\na-problem.\\n8 Verizon v. FCC, 740 F.3d 623, 646 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (\\u201cAlthough Verizon dismisses the \\nCommission\\u2019s assertions regarding broadband providers\\u2019 incentives as \\u2018pure speculation,\\u2019 . . . \\nthose assertions are, at the very least, speculation based firmly in common sense and economic \\nreality.\\u201d) (\\u201cVerizon\\u201d).\\n9 Peter Bright, Verizon Could Be Throttling Netflix and Amazon, but There\\u2019s No Actual Evidence \\nof it, Ars Technica (Feb. 5, 2014), http://arstechnica.com/information-\\ntechnology/2014/02/verizon-could-be-throttling-netflix-and-amazon-but-theres-no-actual-\\nevidence-of-it.\\n\\n4social, and economic participation.10 It enables them to connect with others, express their \\nviewpoints, and obtain basic information and resources.11 Equal access to Internet content thus \\nmeans equal access to opportunities that are vitally important to vulnerable populations in light \\nof the disadvantages and discrimination they face.\\nBenton appreciates the Commission\\u2019s efforts to promote an Open Internet that will \\ncontinue to benefit vulnerable populations and all Internet users. However, we encourage the \\nCommission to take a close look at the issues surrounding use of  Section 706, and consider a \\npathway to achieve meaningful protections through Title II reclassification.\\nII. Section 706 authority does not support a workable Open Internet standard\\nThe Commission has indicated its preference to enact Open Internet standards under \\nSection 706 authority and to enforce those standards on a case-by-case basis. It should carefully \\nconsider the problems with this approach, chief among them the limits of Section 706 and the \\nuncertainty and burden of case-by-case determinations.12\\nA. The D.C. Circuit\\u2019s restrictions on Section 706 authority prevent the Commission \\nfrom effectuating the core principles of an Open Internet\\nSection 706 authorizes the Commission to regulate advanced telecommunications \\ncapability\\u2014including broadband access providers\\u2014as necessary to promote its deployment.13\\nAlthough this authority appears broad, the D.C. Circuit in Verizon limited the provision: Section \\n10 Comments of Media Action Grassroots Network et al., Preserving the Open Internet, GN\\nDocket No. 09-191 (Jan. 14, 2010), at 4-5.\\n11 Ex Parte Presentation by Media Access Project et al., Preserving the Open Internet, GN\\nDocket No. 09-191 (Sept. 16, 2010), at 2.\\n12 Benton Foundation supports the Commission\\u2019s exploration of preempting state laws that \\nrestrict municipal entry into the broadband market through its Section 706 authority. Municipal \\nbroadband can improve poor competitive markets, or can provide the first high-speed broadband \\nconnection in rural areas. States should not restrict these opportunities.\\n13 47 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1302(a) (2014); Verizon, 740 F.3d at 635.\\n\\n5706 cannot be used to impose common carrier obligations, such as the nondiscrimination \\nprinciple, on \\u201cinformation services,\\u201d such as broadband providers.14\\nNon-discrimination lies at the heart of the Open Internet.  For example, the Commission\\nfound\\u2014and the court agreed\\u2014that broadband providers have an incentive to discriminate \\nagainst and among edge providers by charging them fees either to exclude competitors or grant \\nprioritized access to end users.15 Permitting these practices would directly contravene the \\nprinciples underlying an Open Internet, yet the D.C. Circuit indicated that any standard \\nappearing to apply a non-discrimination obligation on an information service would be rejected \\nas common carrier treatment. Thus, without the ability to enforce a non-discrimination principle \\non broadband providers, the Commission cannot ensure an Open Internet.\\nSimilarly, a Section 706 scheme may allow for a robust no-blocking standard, but would\\nsimultaneously undermine a non-discrimination standard.  The D.C. Circuit suggested that the \\nno-blocking rule could be applied to an information service through Section 706 if the service\\noffered were defined as \\u201caccess to subscribers generally\\u201d at a basic level, while leaving room for \\nindividual negotiations.16 This approach, unfortunately, would undermine a non-discrimination\\nstandard because these individual negotiations, by definition, would lead to discrimination based \\non content. In essence, the exception would swallow the rule as content providers with \\neconomic means increasingly negotiate with ISPs for faster transmission. This would severely \\ndisadvantage groups that cannot afford individual negotiations, such as non-profit, community-\\nbased organizations.  The ultimate victims of this scheme would be the vulnerable populations \\nwho most need access to the services provided by these groups.\\n14 Verizon, 750 F.3d at 650 (\\u201c[G]iven the manner in which the Commission has chosen to \\nclassify broadband providers [as information services], the regulations cannot stand.\\u201d).\\n15 Id. at 645-46.\\n16 Id. at 658.\\n\\n6Given this fundamental tension between the goals of robust Open Internet principles and \\nthe express prohibition on treating information services as common carriers, standards \\nestablished under Section 706 would provide an inadequate level of protection.\\nB. Relying on case-by-case determinations provides little certainty and is less \\neffective than a prophylactic rule\\nThe proposal to enforce Open Internet principles through case-by-case adjudication is \\nproblematic because it opens the Commission to new legal liability and burdens all stakeholders,\\nincluding the Commission itself.\\nFirst, a case-by-case approach does not protect against \\u201cas-applied\\u201d challenges for \\napplying obligations that amount to common carriage. The D.C. Circuit\\u2019s treatment of the \\nCommission\\u2019s data roaming rule in Cellco Partnership v. FCC is illustrative. There, the court \\ncautioned that the Commission\\u2019s case-by-case determinations regarding its \\u201ccommercially \\nreasonable\\u201d standard could still be challenged as overly restrictive and, thus, as imposing per se \\ncommon carriage obligations.17 A similar risk is present here. If the Commission were to \\ndetermine through an individual adjudication that a broadband provider had engaged in \\ndiscriminatory conduct, the mere fact of having performed the case-by-case analysis would not \\nshield the Commission from a challenge that it exceeded its Section 706 authority. Similarly, \\naccumulating too much precedent, which could in total give rise to common carrier treatment,\\nwould also subject the agency to legal challenge. The likely end result would be less robust \\nenforcement of Open Internet rules, and more litigation for the agency.\\nSecond, case-by-case determinations burden all parties. Because this approach involves \\nan adjudicator\\u2019s judgment of how specific circumstances square against a particular standard in \\nevery case, the discretion creates additional time and money burdens for the parties before the \\nCommission. The Commission will also face increased burdens, both at the initial stage in \\n17 Cellco P\\u2019ship v. FCC, 700 F.3d 534, 548-49 (D.C. Cir. 2012).\\n\\n7reviewing every case, and at any subsequent stage in defending against an as-applied challenge.\\nGiven that the efficacy of case-by-case determinations is only as good as their enforcement, such \\na burdensome process is troubling.\\nIn total, an approach under Section 706 is problematic.  To achieve its goals of promoting \\nand protecting the Open Internet, the Commission should instead reclassify broadband delivery \\nservices as a Title II telecommunications service.\\nIII. The Commission should reclassify broadband delivery services as a \\n\\u201cTelecommunications Service\\u201d to support robust and effective Open Internet \\nprotections\\nA simpler and more comprehensive approach to achieving the Commission\\u2019s goal of \\nensuring an Open Internet is to reclassify broadband delivery services as a telecommunications \\nservice. Despite the fact that the Commission classified delivery of broadband as a Title I \\ninformation service, these services perform functions that are typically associated with common \\ncarriage. Consumers now also view delivery services as distinct from over-the-top ISP services.  \\nReclassification of delivery of broadband as a Title II service may be a politically difficult \\nchoice, but it is an inevitable choice if the Commission is to ensure the continued value and \\nviability of the Internet.\\nA. Broadband delivery services already act like common carriers\\nBroadband delivery services should be reclassified because they function as common \\ncarriers. The common carrier determination is typically based on common law principles and the \\nactions of particular industries.18 Broadband delivery closely resembles common carriage, and \\nbroadband is increasingly becoming basic infrastructure\\u2014a characteristic of common carriage.\\n18 There is reason to believe that if the Commission were to craft its own definition of \\u201ccommon \\ncarrier,\\u201d it would be entitled to Chevron deference.  Public Knowledge Comments, Protecting \\nand Promoting the Open Internet, GN Docket No. 14-28, at 24 (quoting Cellco P\\u2019ship v. FCC).\\n\\n8Broadband delivery services closely resemble a common carrier offering, such as \\ntelephone service. The delivery of broadband is just like the telephone line, through which \\ncommunications, dictated by users, travel. Under this scheme, the line itself would be a \\ntelecommunications service, subject to some common carrier regulations. The content and \\nservices that pass through the line, \\u201cover-the-top services,\\u201d would still constitute an information \\nservice and would not be regulated.19\\nIncreasingly, broadband Internet has become an essential, basic service20\\u2014a\\ncharacteristic of common carriers. It is now basic infrastructure, like the telephone or electricity.\\nThe role of broadband is largely overtaking the use of the traditional, telephone network. Voice-\\nover-IP has grown substantially, and the use of landline phones has dwindled. A large and \\ngrowing number of Americans communicate through IP-enabled broadband Internet. The \\nCommission should recognize that broadband is essential infrastructure by reclassifying\\nbroadband delivery service as a Title II telecommunications service.\\nB. Consumers do not view their Internet access service as a wholly integrated \\ninformation service\\nAs Benton has previously argued, consumers no longer view their Internet access service \\nas \\u201cintegrated\\u201d with the other services provided by the ISP.21 Since then, the arguments in favor \\n19 The Ninth Circuit accepted this rationale fourteen years ago in AT&T v. City of Portland, 216 \\nF.3d 871, 877-78, 880 (9th Cir. 2000), invalidated by NCTA v. Brand X, 545 U.S. 967, 980 \\n(2005).  However, after Brand X, where the Court held that the FCC\\u2019s classifications deserved \\nChevron deference, the Commission classified essentially all broadband services as information \\nservices.  Appropriate Framework for Broadband Access to the Internet over Wireline Facilities,\\nReport and Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 20 FCC Rcd 14853 (2005); Appropriate \\nRegulatory Treatment for Broadband Access to the Internet over Wireless Networks, Declaratory \\nRuling, 22 FCC Rcd 5901 (2007).\\n20 Internet scholar and expert Susan Crawford often describes the Internet as a basic utility and as \\nan input into almost everything Americans do.  E.g., Ezra Klein Interview with Susan Crawford, \\nVox (Mar. 2014), http://www.vox.com/susan-crawford-internet-public-option.\\n21 Benton Foundation Reply Comments, Framework for Broadband Internet Service, at 5-7, GN \\nDocket No. 10-127 (Aug 12, 2010), http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view?id=7020706148.\\n\\n9of separating the transmission and services components of broadband Internet have only been \\nstrengthened. Services typically provided by ISPs have now proliferated as third-party, cloud-\\nbased services\\u2014including email and webhosting. This proliferation has made those ISP-\\nprovided services all but superfluous. Gmail now has 425 million users.22 Webhosting can be \\ndone through a multitude of services such as Squarespace. Consumers can store their data in any \\nnumber of cloud-based providers, including Box, Dropbox, Sugarsync, and Google Drive. At \\nany rate, the over-the-top services ISPs provide still should be treated as information services by \\nthe Commission. It is the delivery service\\u2014the transmission portion of broadband\\u2014that should \\nbe classified as a Title II telecommunications service.\\nC. Necessary limitations on regulatory authority\\nAfter the Commission reclassifies broadband delivery services as a Title II \\ntelecommunications service, it will then have the option to forbear, under Section 10 of the \\nCommunications Act, from applying common carrier regulations that do not make sense for the \\nmedium.23 This would allow the Commission to enforce the nondiscrimination principle while \\nforbearing on other obligations it determines are not practical in the broadband context.\\nRegardless of whether the Commission reclassifies as proposed in these comments, the \\nCommission should ensure that it will not use its Section 706 authority to hinder broadband \\nexpansion or innovation on the Internet. Section 706 authority is broad\\u2014the Commission could \\nsay that, for example, setting rates on content providers will encourage broadband buildout, and \\ntherefore the Commission could tell Netflix, Google, Yahoo, and other content providers what \\nprice to charge its users.  That would be very harmful to the content providers and Internet users. \\nIt could also harm vulnerable populations that depend on certain services being available and \\n22 Harry McCracken, How Gmail Happened: The Inside Story of its Launch 10 Years Ago, Time \\n(Apr. 1, 2014), http://time.com/43263/gmail-10th-anniversary.\\n23 47 U.S.C. \\u00a7 160(a) (2014).\\n\\n10\\naffordable.  To prevent such use of Section 706, the Commission should clarify that it will not \\nregulate anything other than the transmission (delivery) layer.\\nIV. Reclassification clarifies the Commission\\u2019s authority for updating Universal \\nService Fund programs\\nAs Benton has previously argued,24 reclassifying broadband delivery services would \\nfurther solidify the Commission\\u2019s authority to make necessary updates to universal service \\nprograms including E-Rate, Lifeline, and Link-up. These are vital programs that primarily help \\ndisadvantaged and vulnerable populations, as well as provide schools and libraries with the \\nInternet connections needed to foster the next generation of Internet entrepreneurs and users. \\nThe Commission should not continue to gamble on its currently-uncertain authority; instead, it \\nshould take the path that firmly grounds its authority. Reclassification of broadband delivery \\nservices to Title II is the best way to do that.\\nCONCLUSION\\nFor the above reasons, the FCC should reclassify broadband delivery services as a Title II \\ntelecommunications service.\\nAmina Fazlullah\\nDirector of Policy\\nBenton Foundation\\n1250 Connecticut Ave., NW, Suite 200\\nWashington, DC 20036\\nCatherine Yang\\nGeorgetown Law Student\\nDate: April 11, 2014\\nRespectfully submitted,\\n/s/\\nEric G.

They also shared examples of \\nhow libraries and higher education produce and share content on-line, including digital archives \\nof audio/video files, and distance learning and massively open on-line courses (MOOCs).

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY \\nAOL Inc. (\\u201cAOL\\u201d) supports the Commission\\u2019s efforts to protect the open Internet.  To \\nthat end, the Commission should adopt a firm no-pay-to-play rule preventing broadband Internet \\naccess providers from attempting to levy charges on edge providers in addition to the hefty \\nsubscription fees they receive from consumers.  The Commission should base such a rule on all \\nof the jurisdictional sources at its disposal.  The debate over Section 706 versus Title II as the \\nbasis for the Commission\\u2019s open Internet rules sometimes allows the inference that the two are \\nmutually exclusive.  They need not be.  For example, the Commission can rely on Section 706 \\nfor the primary no-pay-to-play rule, and can use its Title II authority as a backstop that will be \\ntriggered in certain circumstances if the primary rule proves insufficient.   \\nThe Internet provides a unique level playing field that allows small, medium, and large \\ncontent providers to reach customers across the country and around the globe.  AOL is a leading \\nglobal Web services company, providing original, local, and national content, advertising, and \\ncommunications services to the public.  AOL also has the honor of being one of the first \\ncommercially available Internet access providers.  As an Internet pioneer, AOL has witnessed \\nfirst-hand both the value that the Internet has brought to America and the world at large, and can \\n\\n2continue to generate, if left unfettered.  AOL has also witnessed the need for intelligent \\nregulation of the pipes that lead on and off it. \\nII. OPENNESS WAS, AND IS STILL, A CRITICAL ELEMENT TO THE \\nINTERNET\\u2019S GROWTH \\nThe Internet\\u2019s openness has fostered innovation and investment\\u2014both in advancements \\nin network deployment and the services that ride upon them\\u2014creating what the Commission and \\nthe D.C. Circuit have agreed is a virtuous circle, where richer and more diverse content on the \\n\\u201cedge\\u201d jump-starts demand, which brings about infrastructure investment, which brings about \\neven richer and more diverse content.1\\nThe economic effect of this virtuous circle is hard to miss.  By 2016, the Internet is \\nestimated to reach 3 billion users globally, and the Internet economy will reach $4.2 trillion in \\nthe G20 countries alone.2  As the Commission has recognized, in the United States, the Internet \\nhas generated revenues of $263.3 billion.3  That investment in over-the-top services has been a \\nboon for landline broadband Internet Service Providers (\\u201cISPs\\u201d) as well, incentivizing them to \\ninvest significantly in additional capacity.  As the Commission has stated, since 2009, nearly \\n\\u201c$250 billion in private capital has been invested in U.S. wired and wireless broadband.\\u201d4\\n1 The D.C. Circuit endorsed the Commission\\u2019s identification of a virtuous circle of innovation in \\nwhich \\u201cnew uses of the network\\u2014including new content, applications, services, and devices\\u2014\\nlead to increased end-user demand for broadband, which drives network improvements, which in \\nturn lead to further innovative network uses.

FCC 740 F.3d 623, 661 n.4 (D.C. \\nCir. 2014). \\n2 Boston Consulting Group, The Internet Economy in the G-20 (Mar. 19, 2012), available at \\nhttps://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/media_entertainment_strategic_planning_4_2\\n_trillion_opportunity_internet_economy_g20/. \\n3 Promoting and Protecting the Open Internet, GN Docket No. 14-28, Notice of Proposed \\nRulemaking, FCC 14-61 \\u00b6 7 (rel.

AOL\\u2019s success is a direct function of the Internet\\u2019s openness.  AOL has \\nnever controlled the Internet access \\u201con-ramp\\u201d facilities, and its dial-up service has long relied \\non the Commission\\u2019s regulation of the underlying telephone network pipes.  In addition, several \\nyears ago, AOL shifted its primary strategic focus from dial-up access to the advertising-based \\nInternet services model, and has played a significant role in promoting widespread adoption of \\nthat model.  AOL aims to entertain, educate, and connect the world\\u2014all through free, \\nad-supported services.  For example, it owns and operates The Huffington Post, an online news \\naggregator and blog which focuses on politics, business, entertainment, and culture, among \\nothers.  The Huffington Post was the first online-only news organization to win the Pulitzer Prize \\nin 2012.12  AOL also owns and operates TechCrunch, which covers information technology \\ncompanies online, hosts an annual conference for innovators and investors, and operates \\nCrunchBase, a database of start-ups.  Furthermore, AOL owns and operates MapQuest, a free \\nonline web mapping service.  \\nBut this openness, and the mutually reinforcing win-win that comes with it, is fragile.  No \\nless of an authority than the D.C. Circuit has agreed with the Commission\\u2019s findings not only \\n11 See Comcast Business Authorized Dealer, http://www.switchtobroadband.com/20007-\\ninternet-service-providers-page1.html (last visited July 15, 2014); see also Connectnationwide , \\nhttp://connectnationwide.com/verizon-fios/wasington-dc/20007/ (last visited July 15, 2014).\\n12 Michael Calderone, Huffington Post Awarded Pulitzer Prize, Huffington Post, \\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/16/huffington-post-pulitzer-prize-2012\\n_n_1429169.html (last visited July 15, 2014).  \\n\\n5that \\u201cedge-provider innovation leads to the expansion and improvement of broadband \\ninfrastructure,\\u201d13 but also that: \\nx \\u201cContinued innovation at the edge, \\u2018depends upon low barriers to innovation \\nand entry by edge providers,\\u2019 and thus restrictions on edge providers\\u2019 \\u2018ability \\nto reach end users . . . reduce the rate of innovation.\\u2019\\u201d14\\nx Broadband providers, however, \\u201crepresent a threat to Internet openness and \\ncould act in ways that would ultimately inhibit the speed and extent of future \\nbroadband deployment.\\u201d15\\nx The open Internet Rules \\u201cpreserve and facilitate the \\u2018virtuous circle\\u2019 of \\ninnovation that has driven the explosive growth of the Internet.\\u201d16\\nThe Verizon court thus agreed with the Commission that rules are necessary to preserve \\nthe Internet\\u2019s openness.  The question, then, is what those rules should be, and on what \\njurisdictional bases they should be predicated.  AOL believes that the Commission should \\npromulgate a firm no-pay-to-play rule preventing broadband access providers from creating a \\nsecond revenue stream by selling fast lanes, and that the Commission should use the entire legal \\narsenal available to it in support of such a rule.17\\nIII. PAY-TO-PLAY IS WRONG \\nThe beauty of the Internet, as noted above, is that it places power in the hands of \\nconsumers to decide what content and what services they want.  Increasingly, those consumers \\n13 Verizon, 740 F.3d at 644. \\n14 Id. at 645. \\n15 Id.\\n16 Id. at 628. \\n17 AOL agrees with the Commission that the proposed rules should not extend to dial-up Internet \\naccess service providers.  Open Internet NPRM at \\u00b6 55.  For one thing, AOL\\u2019s dial-up business \\ndoes not depend on its own control of any access facilities\\u2014AOL has none.  The same is true of \\nmost other dial-up providers.  As is well known, AOL\\u2019s dial-up subscriber base is declining. \\nThat business cannot afford a totally unnecessary layer of rules. \\n\\n6are seeking products that require high-bandwidth capacity (like high-definition video), low-\\nlatency (like video games), or some combination of the two (like remote access for work).  \\nBroadband ISPs do not know, of course, which services will prove popular among their \\nsubscribers.  So there is presently an incentive to meet consumer demand by building out \\nsufficient capacity for any services that the consumer may want now, and to keep pace with \\npotential future demand for new products, such as 4K video content.\\nFor well-run networks, congestion is the greatest of enemies because it interrupts the \\nenjoyment of the content and services chosen by the ISP\\u2019s subscriber.  Prioritization in an \\nuncongested network is unnecessary, of course, because all content already moves at an optimal \\nrate.  So there is no need for edge providers to purchase it.  In other words, in an uncongested \\nnetwork, prioritization is a solution in need of a problem. \\nThe great concern, then, with the idea of authorizing prioritization of network traffic is \\nthat it provides broadband ISPs with the absolutely wrong incentive:  to commoditize congestion, \\nrather than network performance.  If allowed, pay-to-play would be very lucrative to the \\ngatekeepers in a congested network, where packets move based on their place in the queue.  But \\nbecause monetizing congestion requires ISPs to forego network upgrades, it is unlikely that ISPs \\nwill actually be making available a \\u201cfast lane\\u201d that could open the door to better and more unique \\nservices.\\nInstead of a fast lane, edge providers will merely be purchasing a place in the queue.  \\nAnd an edge provider will enjoy uninterrupted (but probably not \\u201cfaster\\u201d) service relative only to \\nits ability to pay more than other edge providers for a place high up in the queue.  The services of \\nedge providers who are low in the queue, or who cannot afford to bid for a place at all, will be \\nunusable by consumers\\u2014particularly at peak usage times.  As a result, market cap will prevail \\n\\n7over innovation every time, and the uniquely level playing field provided by the Internet will be \\nat an end.  Consumers will suffer the most.  Broadband ISPs have lured the public into \\npurchasing increasingly expensive broadband services on the promise of faster and more stable \\naccess to content.  Prioritization undermines that promise, and places a giant asterisk on \\nconsumers\\u2019 ability to access their content of choice: \\u201cMany restrictions apply.\\u201d\\nCreating an incentive for broadband ISPs to build congested networks also flies directly \\nin the face of the FCC\\u2019s mandate under Section 706.  That provision requires the agency to \\n\\u201cencourage the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications \\ncapability to all Americans.\\u201d18  When, as the Commission has continuously found, broadband \\nISPs are not deploying that capability in \\u201ca reasonable and timely fashion,\\u201d the Commission is \\nrequired to \\u201ctake immediate action to accelerate deployment of such capability by removing \\nbarriers to infrastructure investment and by promoting competition in the telecommunications \\nmarket.\\u201d19  Prioritization is precisely the kind of barrier that Section 706 requires the \\nCommission to eliminate. \\nIV. THE FCC HAS SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY TO PREVENT ISPS FROM \\nUNDERMINING THE INTERNET\\u2019S OPENNESS \\nSection 706 provides the Commission with both the obligation and the power to prevent \\nbroadband ISPs from undermining the virtuous circle.20  To fulfill its mandate, however, the \\nCommission must adopt firmer rules than it has proposed.  The rules can be simple:  \\n18 47 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1302(a). \\n19 Id. \\u00a7 1302(b). \\n20 See id. (\\u201cIn [its annual] inquiry, the Commission shall determine whether advanced \\ntelecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely \\nfashion.  If the Commission\\u2019s determination is negative, it shall take immediate action to \\naccelerate deployment of such capability by removing barriers to infrastructure investment and \\nby promoting competition in the telecommunications market.\\u201d). \\n\\n8x no pay-to-play when a broadband access provider is affiliated with an \\nupstream edge provider; \\nx no pay-to-play when a broadband access provider has market power; \\nx no pay-to-play when a broadband access provider also charges end users (i.e., \\nno double-charging); and \\nx outside of these cases, any pay-to-play proposal only subject to Commission \\nprior-approval.\\nThese rules are sufficiently different from common carrier rules to pass muster under \\nVerizon.  For example, Title II\\u2019s prohibition on discrimination applies to all carriers regardless of \\naffiliation and market power.  And there is nothing common-carrier-specific about a prohibition \\non double-charging.\\nThis does not mean that Title II is not necessary or valuable.  Combatting pay-to-play is \\nso important to the Internet industry and therefore, via the virtuous circle, to broadband \\ninfrastructure deployment, that the Commission needs its entire jurisdictional arsenal.  Tile II can \\nserve as a backdrop that is triggered (along with a set of appropriately firm Title II rules) if \\nSection 706 rules prove insufficient.\\nThe Commission has also asked how to \\u201censure that a broadband service provider would \\nnot be able to evade our open Internet rules by engaging in traffic exchange practices that would \\nbe outside the scope of the rules.\\u201d21  While the Commission is examining interconnection \\npractices more broadly elsewhere, AOL believes that the Commission should not allow form to \\nprevail over substance.  What matters most is the consumer.  If the consumer rights that are \\nmeant to be protected by the open Internet rules are affected by a gatekeeper\\u2019s interconnection \\npractices, the label of a charge as an interconnection fee or a fast-lane fee may not matter, and \\nthe Commission should prohibit attempts to evade or circumvent the open Internet rules.\\n21 Id. at 22 \\u00b6 59.\\n\\n9V. CONCLUSION \\nCrafting a strong rule prohibiting pay-to-play arrangements is essential to preserving the \\nopen Internet and the virtuous circle that it perpetuates.  Section 706 and Title II need not be \\nmutually exclusive means to that end.  In order to achieve the paramount objective of protecting \\nconsumers, they can, and should, both be used\\u2014the first as a basis for a no-pay-to-play rule \\nstronger than the Commission has proposed, and the other as a backstop to the extent necessary. \\nRespectfully submitted, \\n   /s/     /s/  \\nPantelis Michalopoulos \\nAndrew W.

Specifically, communications services intended to replace \\nPOTS (plain old telephone service) must meet certain technical criteria, and testing of alarm \\nfunctionality and line seizure by the telecommunications provider are necessary and critical life \\nsafety components of any new communications service installation. To that end, proper testing \\nand data collection regarding post installation alarm functionality should be incorporated into the \\nTechnology Transitions trials. \\nThe alarm industry also continues to work with IP communications service providers to develop \\ntechnical agreements for all IP technologies that base their communications on Managed \\nFacilities-Based Voice Network (MFVN) standards. This effort will help ensure alarm \\nmonitoring systems that are already in place to protect consumers' homes and businesses have \\nthe necessary system functionality to transmit alarm signals from the protected location to the \\nmonitoring center. \\nRegarding the Open Internet, public safety and lifesaving services such as home alarm systems \\nand school and business security must travel across the broadband network without the threat of \\nde-prioritization. Alarm and other life safety home automation signaling consist of small, \\ndiscrete packet types transmitted from the customer's alarm location, across the network(s), to \\n\\nthe monitoring center in a matter of seconds. The associated carrying costs are de minimis and \\ndo not generate an incentive to de-prioritize this traffic. \\nSincerely, \\nRachel Sanford \\nCc: Nicholas Degani \\nj\", \n",

(\\\"Cogent\\\"), joined by Jim Denvir and Hershel Wancjer ofBoies, Schiller & Flexner LLP, \\nmet with Philip Verveer, Senior Counselor; Jonathan Sallet, Acting General Counsel; and \\nStephanie Weiner, Associate General Counsel. \\nDuring our meeting, Mr. Schaeffer, Cogent's Founder and Chief Executive Officer, \\nexplained that Cogent, a multinational Tier 1 Internet service provider that carries approximately \\n21% of the world's Internet traffic, is consistently ranked as one of the top five networks in the \\nworld. As the cost of Internet access provided by Cogent has continued to fall by approximately \\n22% per year over the past five years, innovative edge providers like Netflix (and its nascent \\ncompetitors) have been able to deliver new high-bandwidth services to consumers. During the \\nsame period, however, large Internet access providers (lAPs) like Verizon, Comcast, Time \\nWarner Cable and AT&T have not reduced the cost of Internet access to consumers who \\nsubscribe to their broadband services. \\nOver the past 18 months, consumer demand for streaming video and other bandwidth\\u00ad\\nintensive content has increased dramatically. As Mr. Schaeffer explained, the large integrated \\nbroadband providers- who have an incentive to steer their subscribers toward their own on\\u00ad\\ndemand services (e.g., Verizon's Redbox Instant or Comcast's XFinity On Demand) and away \\nfrom competitive services offered by unaffiliated edge providers (e.g., Netflix, You Tube or \\nSkype )- are refusing to upgrade their network connections with companies like Cogent. The \\nresult is a degraded quality of service to end-users. Moreover, lAPs have sold their customers \\nsomething they cannot (or will not) deliver--consistent access to the entire Internet at advertised \\nspeeds. Thus, while companies like Cogent- whose sole business is the provision of Internet \\naccess- have a vested interest in optimal Internet functionality, vertically-integrated lAPs do not \\nshare this interest. \\nWe also briefly discussed the comments Cogent recently filed in the Commission's new \\nopen Internet proceeding. In particular, Mr. Schaeffer emphasized Cogent's belief that \\nbroadband Internet access should be reclassified as a Title II telecommunications service, \\nincluding the attendant common-carrier obligations that accompany such classification. If the \\nWWW .BSFLLP.COM \\n\\nBOIES, SCHILLER & FLEXNER LLP \\nCommission opts not to reclassify at this time, Mr. Schaeffer suggested that the proposals set \\nforth in Cogent's comments offer ways to enhance the current transparency rule and to identify \\nand remedy network congestion. \\nPlease direct any questions regarding this correspondence to my attention. \\ncc: Philip Verveer \\nJonathan Sallet \\nStephanie Weiner \\nSincerely,\", \n",

        "  \"text\": \"Said best by Tim Wu: \\nHistory shows that when a small group of private companies owns an essential part of the \\nnation's infrastructure, the potential for abuse is serious. \\nWe need to stop pretending the U.S. broadband industry forms some kind of magical exception \\nto this rule. For 15 years, consumers have been waiting for serious competition to arrive, yet \\nthere is now less competition than ever. It's time to face facts: Broadband is a utility and ought to \\nbe treated as such by the Federal Communications Commission. \\nThat broadband has become a utility is obvious to anyone outside of Washington. It is hard to live \\nor do business without the Internet, and the degree to which we take it for granted suggests \\nbroadband is an essential part of the U.S. infrastructure. As the main delivery system for so \\nmany businesses, cultural content and news, broadband has particular importance. \\nThe broadband market, like historic utilities, is prone to concentration. High profit margins \\n(broadband costs less than $5 a month to provide and is sold for $40 to $60 a month) are \\nprotected by high barriers to market entry: Wiring of homes is expensive, and entrants face a \\ncompetitor who has already paid off its infrastructure. \\nSo, despite 15 years of high hopes, cable operators are the dominant providers of Internet \\naccess in nearly every important market in the U.S. Verizon's FiOS service, a worthy competitor \\nin some areas, has a national market share of just 8%. Google Fiber has less than 1%. These \\nnumbers may eventually change, but we need to face the market as it is today, not as we hope it \\nmight be. \\nToll Collectors \\nSimilar signs of essentiality and market power have led to government oversight of broadband's \\npredecessors, including the phone and electricity systems. The concerns were similar: that \\ncontrol over such a critical part of the nation's infrastructure, if abused, would be too costly to \\ntolerate. \\nImagine that a private company owned the only bridge into Manhattan over the Hudson River. It \\nisn't hard to see how that would put the owner in a position to extract cash from the rest of the \\neconomy, almost like a tax. Another, more subtle effect is the favoring of some businesses over \\nothers, distorting competition and innovation in other parts of the economy. \\n\\nBroadband operators today own the effective bridges to the American home, and they have \\nshown an inclination to use that power. Recently, they have induced direct competitors such as \\nNetflix to agree to pay fees to ensure smoother streaming of content to customers, pegging the \\npayments as \\\"contributions\\\" to their networks. \\nThe Right Balance \\nClassifying broadband as a \\\"common carrier\\\" under the 1934 Telecommunication Act would \\nallow the FCC to use the full extent of its authority to prevent broadband providers from \\nextracting tolls that damage the broader economy. It also would allow the FCC to reinstate the \\n\\\"net neutrality\\\" rules that courts have recently struck down. \\nThat said, excessive regulation can stagnate an industry, and it's important not to go overboard. \\nThere has to be a balance between protecting the public and leaving the industry room to grow. \\n\\\"Open Internet\\\" rules strike that balance: They prevent broadband providers from blocking or \\ndiscriminating against certain types of content, while still allowing the extraordinary profit margins \\nthat reward the initial investment. \\nSome believe, based more on faith than logic, that competition will always flourish if government \\ngets out of the way. If only that were true. In fact, in high fixed-cost industries, the market yields \\nunregulated monopolies that extract a cost on the entire economy. \\nIt is foolish to pretend broadband forms some kind of magical exception to the historic problem \\nposed by private ownership of the economy's essential infrastructures. We need to remember \\nthat monopoly profits ultimately function as a tax on the rest of the economy, and act \\naccordingly.\", \n",

Introduction \\nJordan Gore submits these comments in response to the Notice of Proposed \\nRulemaking (\\u201cNPRM\\u201d) issued by the Wireline Competition Bureau on May 15, 2014 in \\nthe above-captioned docket on \\u201cProtecting and Promoting the Open Internet.\\u201d  The \\nNPRM had explained that this docket had been opened to address a fundamental \\nquestion: What is the right public policy to ensure that the Internet remains open?  In \\nVerizon v. FCC1, the D.C. Circuit remanded the Commission\\u2019s Open Internet Order,2 and \\nthat decision vacated Open Internet rules that prohibited blocking and unreasonable \\ndiscrimination by broadband Internet service providers. \\nAs articulated in the NPRM, today there are no legally enforceable rules by which \\nthe Commission can stop broadband providers from limiting Internet openness.  The D.C. \\nCircuit\\u2019s recent decision in Verizon makes it clear that the Commission\\u2019s reliance on \\nsection 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is inadequate to prevent undue \\ndiscrimination by broadband Internet service providers.  The Commission has a duty \\nunder the Act to prevent unreasonable discrimination online and on our public \\ntelecommunications network.  In order for the Commission to fulfill its mandate to \\u201cmake \\navailable, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States \\u2026 a rapid, efficient, \\nNation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service,\\u201d3 the Commission \\nmust \\u2026. Ensure that the power to control the Internet must come from the \\nconsumer. \\n \\n                                                     \\n1 Verizon v. FCC, No. 11-1355 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 14, 2014). \\n2 Preserving the Open Internet, GN Docket No. 09-191, WC Docket No. 07-52, Report and  \\nOrder, 25 FCC Rcd 17905 (2010) (\\u201cOpen Internet Order\\u201d).  \\n3 47 U.S.C. \\u00a7 151. \\n\\nComment on FCC NPRM No. 14-28 \\n 3\\n \\nII.  Statement The regulation of the Internet is something that has been debated \\nsince its creation. Larger companies have always felt the need to assert themselves in as \\nmany forms of communication as they possibly can, and such is the American way. \\nHowever, the arrival of the Internet and its accelerated dominance over the country is a \\ngrowing issue. In this day and age, humans have literally the answer to everything in their \\npockets. Now that Internet is mobile and accessible, it brings up many interesting \\nquestions. For one, who is paying for Internet services, and are you really getting what \\nyou pay for?  \\nThe FCC\\u2019s regulation over large companies such as Comcast and Time Warner \\nwould not only hurt the Internet\\u2019s usage, but the providers and consumers as well. By \\njacking up prices for broadband, it would create a ripple effect of higher costs and lower \\nspeeds. The Internet providers such as Comcast would be forced to pay more for higher \\nspeed connections, in turn causing them to raises costs for other large Internet companies \\nsuch as Youtube and Netflix. It would force consumers to start paying more money if \\nthey want access to high speed broadband.  \\nThis is a very large problem, because in a day and age where the value of \\nAmerican currency is already at an all time low, people simply can\\u2019t afford to keep \\nshelling out dollars that they do not have. Free services like Youtube and Facebook may \\nstart requiring you to purchase an account, and pay a monthly fee in order to use the site. \\nOther companies would be forced to do the same if they wanted to keep up with the \\ncompetition. It would essentially create a cash flow funnel directly to the large, corporate \\ncompanies that already have unlimited resources. The big fish get bigger and the rest are \\n\\nComment on FCC NPRM No. 14-28 \\n 4\\njust bottom feeders.  \\nAnother problem with the regulations would be that smaller businesses would \\nhave no chance at making money. If someone wanted to start a business, the amount they \\nwould need to pay in order to get off the ground and get known would be outrageous. The \\nbroadband they would receive wouldn\\u2019t even be half the speed of the big companies, and \\nthere would be very little success in making a profit. Eventually they would get \\nswallowed up and absorbed by the giants that can afford the costs of the best Internet \\nservice available, and in turn would lead to more regulations of content.  \\nThe issue of the FCC regulations would take some of the basic freedom away \\nfrom the people. The beauty of the Internet is that you can see literally anything at any \\ntime. The control of content is something that the consumer should control, not the \\nprovider. By regulating content, it allows for greater control over the population. China, \\nfor example, is so tightly regulated, that most citizens aren\\u2019t even aware of important \\nrecent Chinese history that is valuable to the nation.  \\nIt also gives an average person the chance for their voice to be heard. This \\ncomment for instance, could never have reached you without the use of the Internet. I \\nwouldn\\u2019t have been able to afford the cost for high speed broadband. Access to the \\nInternet is one of the great things about America, in that almost everyone can do it for \\nfree. It allows anyone to get his or her voice out into the world and heard. \\nI don\\u2019t believe this is necessarily a legal issue, but more of an ethical one. This \\ncountry has always been about Capitalism, but it has also been about freedom of the \\npeople. That is where I believe the regulations should come from. The providers \\nshouldn\\u2019t be able to tell us what to see and how to use our Internet, but that power should \\n\\nComment on FCC NPRM No. 14-28 \\n 5\\nbe made available. There needs to be a way for a person to regulate what comes into their \\nown homes. If a consumer is paying for services, they should also be able to block \\nwhatever sites they don\\u2019t want to see or have access to. Having children is a challenge \\nthese days because of the unlimited Internet access, and the parent needs to be able to \\nregulate what sort of information they have access to, such as blocking pornographic sites \\nor overly violent sites with violent messages.  \\n \\nIII. Conclusion In conclusion, I believe the power to regulate and control the \\nInternet needs to rest with the consumers. The Internet must remain free, because people \\ncan\\u2019t afford to pay higher costs for fast speeds. Regulation is very important, but the real \\nquestion lies with who is in charge of that regulation. It is necessary that we make the \\nchanges so that Internet can be used to its full potential. The time has come to put the \\npower where it truly belongs: in the hands of the people.  \\n \\n \\n  \\n      Respectfully submitted, \\n      /s/ Jordan J.

Furthermore, network control should\\nnot be used to extract fees from edge providers to secure faster or more reliable connectivity.  \\nThe Board understands net neutrality to have the meaning expressed in various\\nresolutions of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (\\u201cNARUC\\u201d).   Net3\\nneutrality involves the right of consumers to access the Internet without restrictions as to\\nviewpoint and in a manner that does not involve unreasonable discrimination as to the lawful \\nchoice of content (including software applications).  Furthermore, net neutrality means\\ntransparency; that is, consumers must receive meaningful information regarding the technical\\nlimitations of their broadband service.  The FCC should regulate so as to uphold and advance\\nthese tenets. \\n    3.  See NARUC November 13, 2002 Resolution Regarding Citizen Access to Internet Content at\\nhttp://www.naruc.org/Resolutions/Resolution%20on%20Fair%20and%20Non%20Discriminatory%20Access%20to\\n%20Content.pdf and NARUC February 17, 2010 Resolution on Open Access to the Internet at\\nhttp://www.naruc.org/Resolutions/Resolution%20on%20Net%20Neutrality.pdf.\\n\\nVermont Public Service Board Comments p. 3\\nGN Docket No. 14-28\\nAs we have seen, the absence of regulation to uphold net neutrality can and does result in\\nbroadband service providers favoring their own content over the content of their competitors.4\\nMoreover, some Internet service providers are advocating for the ability to limit access to\\nbandwidth unless edge providers pay fees for faster or better service, a practice which stands in\\nstark contrast to NARUC\\u2019s net neutrality principles.   In the face of these types of activities, the5\\nBoard urges the FCC to take an active role in reinstating net neutrality rules and principles of\\nconduct.\\n(2) The FCC should reclassify broadband service as a \\u201ctelecommunications service\\u201d\\nunder Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the 1996 Act.6\\nThe best option available to the Commission would be to reclassify broadband internet\\naccess service as a telecommunications service under Title II.  The 1996 Act defines\\n\\u201ctelecommunications service\\u201d as \\u201cthe offering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the\\npublic, or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public, regardless\\nof the facilities used.\\u201d \\u201cTelecommunications\\u201d is defined in turn as \\u201cthe transmission, between or\\namong points specified by the user, of information of the user\\u2019s choosing, without change in the\\nform or content of the information as sent and received.\\u201d  Notwithstanding prior FCC\\ndeterminations, from the standpoint of consumers, broadband service is clearly\\ntelecommunications within this definition.  It provides transmission between two points, without\\na change in the form or the content.  Users may use services that do create a change in the\\n    4.  Recall Comcast\\u2019s \\u201cthrottling\\u201d of BitTorrent traffic in 2007-2008 that was an impetus for the issuance of the\\nOpen Internet Order.\\n    5.  See T. Karr. (2013, Sept.18).

By doing so, the Commission, at the urging of industry, 7\\nhandcuffed itself and limited its ability to preserve net neutrality and the open Internet.  The\\nCommission\\u2019s treatment of dial-up access highlights this error.  Internet access, whether through\\nbroadband or dial-up, is functionally the same for consumers, except for the speed.  Yet the latter\\nhas been classified as a Title II service (for good reason).  Somehow, the former was considered\\nnot as a separate access service that should be treated similarly but as a bundled product.  This\\nhas worked well for some carriers, but the distinction is arbitrary.\\nFortunately, this mistake can be rectified by reclassifying broadband services as\\na\\u201ctelecommunications service,\\u201d  which is subject to the common carrier duties of Title II.   By8 9\\nreclassifying broadband service, the FCC will once again have the authority and tools it needs to\\nrequire broadband service providers to uphold net neutrality, which will advance transparency,\\ninnovation, competition, and Free Speech.\\n    7.

Given that the focus of this proceeding is on broadband service, we will limit our comments to broadband.\\n    9.  Among these duties are the duty to charge reasonable rates and the duty to offer non discriminatory service. \\nSee 47 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 201 and 202.\\n\\nVermont Public Service Board Comments p. 5\\nGN Docket No. 14-28\\nA benefit in addition to preserving net neutrality is that a reclassification of broadband\\nservices to telecommunications services would enhance the ability of states to extend broadband\\nservice to more consumers, a long stated goal of Congress and the Commission.  This is\\nparticularly true in rural states like Vermont.  The Universal Service Fund is limited to funding\\ntelecommunications services, which means currently states can not use Universal Service Funds\\nto help expand broadband service (an information service).  Reclassifying broadband services as\\ntelecommunications services would eliminate this impediment and enable states to use Universal\\nService Funds to expand fast, broadband interconnectivity to more consumers.\\n(3) The FCC should treat equally communications technologies that appear from the\\nconsumers\\u2019 standpoint to be the same kinds of service. \\nThe Board respectfully recommends that the FCC should institute regulations that treat\\ncommunications technologies, which appear from the consumer\\u2019s standpoint to be the same, in\\nan evenhanded way.  The average person who picks up a device that looks like a telephone and\\noperates like a telephone certainly can be expected to assume that his or her interactions with that\\ndevice will be just like his or her prior interactions with a telephone.  Of course, a consumer\\nwould therefore expect the same consumer protections to adhere.  This is reasonable behavior. \\nThe average consumer can not and should not be expected to parse the technological differences\\ngoing on behind the scenes of each telephone-like technology so as to determine what protections\\nexist for him or her.\\nUnfortunately, this is not currently the case.  Certain telephone-like technologies used\\nover a broadband service are not treated by the FCC the same as a traditional telephone. \\nTelephone-like technologies are now considered information services, which are not subject to\\n\\nVermont Public Service Board Comments p. 6\\nGN Docket No. 14-28\\nsimilar regulations as telephone service, which is classified as a telecommunications service. \\nThis distinction in treatment can and does lead to consumer confusion.\\nVoIP is an excellent example of this phenomenon.  VoIP is a telephone-like technology. \\nA consumer picks up a VoIP device and makes a \\u201ctelephone\\u201d call.  However, unlike a traditional\\ncall that would travel over a switched network, a VoIP call travels in packets.  Because of this\\nbehind-the-scenes difference, which has nothing to do with the statutory definition of\\ntelecommunications service, a VoIP call is classified as an information service that is not subject\\nto traditional regulations that confer upon the consumer certain protections that consumers have\\ncome to expect when using their telephone.  For instance, VoIP providers are not held to the\\nsame call-completion and reliability standards that their telephone counterparts are.  This can and\\ndoes lead to confusion and frustration for consumers.\\nThe FCC should rectify this problem and eliminate confusion by reclassifying broadband\\nservice as a telecommunications service and apply to it the same Title II requirements that adhere\\nto telecommunications services.  This will result in comparable regulatory treatment for\\ncomparable services, and it will reduce consumer confusion about the services they use.\\n(4) The FCC should consider the states as laboratories for experimentation.\\nAssuming that the Commission wants to review scenarios where broadband services are\\nreclassified as \\u201ctelecommunications services,\\u201d the Commission would be well served to work\\nclosely with the states in designing and implementing these scenarios.  The states possess a deep\\nand rich pool of experience from which the FCC can draw important lessons.  Additionally, there\\nis already in place a Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service that effectively can facilitate\\n\\nVermont Public Service Board Comments p. 7\\nGN Docket No. 14-28\\njoint efforts among the Federal and state governments.  For these reasons, it is entirely reasonable\\nfor Federal and state regulators to be working together closely to create a regulatory regime that\\nsupports net neutrality, effectively protects consumers, and provides industry with the space and\\nflexibility for innovation and competition.\\nCONCLUSION\\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Board respectfully urges the FCC to reclassify broadband\\nservices as \\u201ctelecommunications services\\u201d subject to the common carrier requirements of Title II. \\nIn doing so, the Commission will ensure net neutrality, protect consumers, and provide room for\\ninnovation, competition, and growth in the industry.\\nDated at Montpelier, Vermont, this 24th day of March        , 2014.\\n)\\ns/ James Volz )\\n) PUBLIC SERVICE\\n)\\n       s/ John D.

My previous experience in this field includes work with Professor Simon Wilkie of \\nthe University of Southern California Gould School of Law and the California Institute of \\nTechnology on radio spectrum auctions and public spectrum protocols. \\nMy proposal will allow Internet service providers (ISPs) and content providers to contract \\nfor priority transmission services and yet will protect smaller content providers\\u2019 ability to \\ncompete on a level playing field.  My proposal is as follows: \\nx The FCC will not place any restrictions on the ability of ISPs and content \\nproviders to contract for priority transmission services, except that\\u2014 \\no All agreements between ISPs and content providers will be publicly \\navailable on FCC\\u2019s website, with a one-page summary of material \\neconomic terms. \\no Priority transmission services contracts may not be exclusive: ISPs will be \\nrequired to offer priority transmission services to all content providers on \\nthe same economic terms on a \\u201cmost favored nation\\u201d (MFN) basis.  To \\nfacilitate this, each contract must have a form agreement that any other \\ncontent provider may use to purchase priority transmission services under \\nthe same economic terms on a MFN basis. \\no There can be no restrictive terms that would constitute de facto barriers \\npreventing smaller content providers from purchasing priority \\ntransmission services under the same economic terms, e.g., excessively \\nlarge minimum buys, prohibitive credit terms, etc. \\n\\nJune 4, 2014 \\nPage Two \\nI believe that the above proposal would be easy to implement.  It would not require \\nadditional government oversight or restrictions on the ability of ISPs and content providers to \\narrive at the most efficient economic solutions.  It would ensure transparency.  It would prevent \\nlarger, established content providers from using their superior market position to stifle new, less-\\nestablished competition.  At the same time, it allows ISPs to engage in free-market negotiations \\nand transactions that will allow for priority transmission services. \\nFrom a public relations standpoint, proper communication of the effect of the proposal, if \\nadopted, would lessen public opposition to the current proposed rule changes. \\nPlease consider the proposal.  Please contact me if I may be of any service in the FCC\\u2019s \\nrule-making process. \\nSincerely,\\nPARSONS BEHLE & LATIMER \\nBrian M. Rothschild \\nBrian M.

All the while, U-Verse and other next generation telephony services are \\ndeployed by American Telegraph & Telephone Company (AT&T), leaving Public Utility \\ncommissions and other regulatory agencies with limited to no control over uptime and reliability \\nof telecom services that AT&T and other cable and traditional wire-line providers offer. \\nTo outline just a few of the widespread residential and business class DSL (digital \\nsubscriber line) and U-Verse voice/internet outages. On January 27, 2014 one of the nation's \\nlargest telecommunications providers, AT&T, suffered a broadband outage affecting AT&T u-\\nverse customers all across the nation.  These broadband services are vital for consumer as well as \\nbusiness customers and will continue to be more vital as AT&T begins plans to phase out DSL \\n(Digital Subscriber Line) services over the next couple of years.   \\nFor a growing number of Americans, broadband services are increasingly becoming vital \\nfor industry and business operations as employees and corporate executives take the office with \\nthem and work from home. Furthermore, information technology companies like AT&T, IBM, \\nHitachi Data Systems, Computer Associates and other IT companies have a number of \\nemployees who telecommute and do not have a physical office they go to; these employees \\ndepend on fast, reliable connections, to corporate VPNs and corporate WANS to perform their \\njobs.  Moreover, broadband services are vital for life saving services; such as home automation, \\nlife alert products for seniors and the disabled, security systems and telepresence services, that \\nrely on some type of internet connection to contact a monitoring center.  What is even more \\ntroubling however, is the fact that in many cases, due to AT&Ts direct lobbying efforts and \\nability to increase transit costs passed onto regional competitors, the vast majority of customers \\nin many of these areas have only one or two choices for internet connectivity providers (AT&T \\nor Comcast, and in some locations Time Warner Cable) and are forced to use AT&T Internet \\nProtocol (IP) services like Uverse.  More troubling is the fact that AT&T and it's executives lead \\nby AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Senior VP and General Counsel for AT&T have \\nreaffirmed a commitment to transition AT&T customers to all IP based services; that provide a \\nmixture of Internet, Voice and Television services to consumer and business customers.  This is \\ndespite objection from a number of leading independent consumer advocacy groups, including \\nPublic Knowledge and AARP (American Association of Retired Persons).  \\n                                                          \\n2 http://www.kentucky.com/2014/01/30/3060737/senate-panel-approves-att-bill.html -  Kentucky senate passes \\n'AT&T bill' to further deregulate phone service \\n\\nOne South Dearborn Chicago IL 60603 \\n21st Century Telecommunications Initiative / Point Plus Partners   Page#3 \\n \\nFor millions of broadband customers who cannot choose a local carrier, these outages by \\nAT&T are unacceptable.  According to Lightreading3 an online telephony publication, AT&T's \\nlatest outage affected customers in several states and metropolitan areas, resulting in over 1000 \\nreported and tracked complaints.  Including Texas which is where SBC Telecommunications \\nd/b/a AT&T corporate Headquarters is located in.  The total number of affected customers and \\nclients of AT&T in these areas is significantly more, as not everyone may been at home or work \\nin an office that relies on AT&T U-VERSE service at the time of the outage(s). According to \\nreports U-verse services were affected in California, Texas, New York, Chicago, Missouri and \\nseveral other city and states.  \\nIn this case AT&T was able to address the situation and eventually fix the problem.  \\nHowever, this outage and several others, illustrates the greater need for government oversight, to \\nprotect consumers and businesses in order to protect this vital national telecommunications \\ninfrastructure. In a prepared statement AT&T released the largest telecommunications provider \\nin the US and world stated: \\nA limited number of AT&T customers across multiple states may have experienced a disruption \\nwith U-Verse high speed internet service due to a third-party web hosting service issue. \\nThis statement and outage is troubling for many reasons, with the greatest concern being \\nthat broadband services across the entire country can be impeded by a single third-party supplier \\nthat AT&T apparently relies on to provide services.  \\nThis is why it is vital that there remains government oversight to protect the \\ntelecommunications and internet infrastructure.  And to further investigate why the world's \\nlargest telecommunications provider relies on a single third party vendor and thus single point of \\nfailure and what if any measures have been taken or are considering being implemented to \\nprevent another national outage on the AT&T U-Verse product/service? \\nThe second Major outage occurred; on January 21, 2013 AT&T faced another similar \\nnational outage, which affected customers in Louisiana, Kentucky, Texas, Georgia, Tennessee, \\nFlorida and Arkansas.  Customers eventually had to turn to AT&Ts Facebook page and twitter \\non Martin Luther King Day in 2013, to find out why they lost internet connectivity and when \\nservices would be restored. AT&T eventually did make another public apology to affected \\nconsumers this time expressing:  \\n                                                          \\n3 http://www.lightreading.com/atandt-u-verse-suffers-nationwide-outage/d/d-\\nid/707438?f_src=lightreading_gnews  \\n \\n\\nOne South Dearborn Chicago IL 60603 \\n21st Century Telecommunications Initiative / Point Plus Partners   Page#4 \\n \\nA limited number of AT&T customers in some markets may be experiencing issues with U-\\nVerse service. A team of engineers4 and technicians are working to resolve the issue, and we \\napologize for any inconvenience to our customers5.  \\nThe third major outage occurred on February 22, 2012 affecting customers across the \\nChicago metro area. This outage lasted six hours and affected virtually all users across the \\nChicago area.  According to Crain's Chicago6 business report a leading business and trade \\npublication covering Chicago.  AT&T issued the following statement: \\nThe outage began around 3 a.m. due to a \\\"network issue\\\" and was resolved by 9 a.m. \\n There are numerous other examples of widespread service or network outages, which \\nAT&T has yet to provide a definitive answer to in regards to what is being done to correct the \\nongoing national problems that have plagued AT&Ts network.  On several occasions I [Joseph \\nLibuszowski] have expressed serious concern about regarding these issues; to a number of first \\ntier, second tier employees of AT&T and have got nowhere.  Even our attorneys and corporate \\nclients, who have had similar issues, also have had no response from the telecommunications \\ncompany even when they have been threatened with litigation, if the company cannot provide \\nreasonable service reliability on the carrier\\u2019s network. It is such a serious issue, that we have also \\nraised the matter to AT&T's executives both in New Jersey as well as Dallas Texas including but \\nnot limited to AT&T Chief Security Officer Edward Amoroso7 and AT&T's Group President and \\nChief Strategy Officer John T. Stankey8 regarding the service outages.   \\nThere is clear need for redundancy/failover protection on AT&Ts PPOE (point to point \\nprotocol over Ethernet) authentication servers in the case of the DSL outage and AT&T u-verse \\nauthentication servers, to prevent any future nationwide \\\"third party service outages.\\\"  As of this \\ndate May 13, 2014 neither AT&T nor its network operations center has implemented such \\nsolutions to the best of our knowledge.  While we understand that technology sometimes fails \\nand emergency repairs need to be made, the repeated failures suggest that the issue(s) have not \\n                                                          \\n4 http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/ATT-UVerse-Suffering-Large-National-Outage-122841  \\n \\n5 http://www.pcworld.com/article/2026174/atandt-users-slam-uverse-outage.html  \\n \\n6 http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20120222/NEWS08/120229941/at-t-internet-service-\\noutage-lasted-6-hours  \\n7 http://networkingexchangeblog.att.com/bio/ed-amoroso/ \\n \\n8 http://www.att.com/gen/investor-relations?pid=9816 \\n \\n\\nOne South Dearborn Chicago IL 60603 \\n21st Century Telecommunications Initiative / Point Plus Partners   Page#5 \\n \\nbeen adequately addressed as they should.  It is unacceptable when the vast majority of AT&T \\nresidential and business customers have to rely on AT&T telecommunications services that \\nsimply are not reliable.  Moreover when service issues affect such a widespread and diverse part \\nof the United States and consumers are largely forced to rely on these providers, it makes things \\nburdensome on customers of these carriers.   \\nAs an example, several of our IP attorneys and I have worked in the telecommunications \\nfield for a number of years both at large nationwide carriers like AT&T as well as smaller \\nnational carriers and regional carriers like McLeodUSA which through a M&A was purchased \\nby Paetec Communications9 which through another M&A was purchased by Windstream10 \\nCommunications.  While employed at McLeodUSA we had a similar issue where parts of \\nMichigan were unable to access the internet, due to an update on a Cisco router becoming \\ncorrupt and as a result technicians had to reload the router tables.  However, after that issue the \\ncompany (McLeodUSA) created a remediation and plan to prevent issues, from occuring in the \\nfuture.  So we fully understand that issues do occur and cause downtime and pain for business as \\nwell as retail residential customers. \\nHowever, what we do not understand and what is increasingly troubling, is the continued \\ndowntime and issues and seemingly the inability to have any redundancy built-in to AT&T's \\nsystems to prevent these problems from continuing to occur.  If these problems occurred a single \\ntime and were fixed and plans and procedures were put into place to prevent a single point of \\nfailure from occurring, that is acceptable.  But when a provider is unable to provide reliable \\nservice, and has no redundancy built-in to basic systems such as their PPOE authentication \\nserver(s) or \\\"third-party web hosting service issue\\\", not only are these problems troubling, but \\ncan actually be deadly for people that rely on connectivity to power their alarm systems, and \\nother emergency medical devices.  Especially since, there are several police and fire departments \\nand small doctors and medical offices that rely on services from AT&T, Verizon & Comcast to \\nprovide reliable and dependable services.   \\nRespectfully Submitted, \\n/s/ Joseph A.

We also explained that, to the extent the Commission considers adopting a revised no-\\nblocking rule as a regulatory backstop to the transparency rule, it should seek to ensure that any \\nsuch requirement gives parties sufficient flexibility to reach individualized agreements so as to \\navoid imposing common carrier-style obligations.  We further restated the points made in our \\ncomments that the Commission\\u2019s consideration of revised rules should avoid arbitrary \\ndistinctions between fixed and mobile broadband services and holistically examine all parts of \\n                                                 \\n1\\n  Verizon v.

No. 14-28) \\nDear Ms. Dortch: \\nI am writing pursuant to Section 1.1206(b)(2) of the Commission\\u2019s Rules to notify the \\nCommission that on Thursday, May 1, Jeffrey Campbell of Cisco Systems, Inc. (\\u201cCisco\\u201d) and \\nthe undersigned participated in one meeting with Rebekah Goodheart and Stefanie Frank of \\nCommissioner Clyburn\\u2019s office, and another meeting with Priscilla Argeris of Commissioner \\nRosenworcel\\u2019s office \\u2013 to discuss the above-referenced matter.   \\nDuring the two meetings, Cisco noted that recent decisions made by foreign governments \\nthreaten to undercut innovation and investment in the broadband Internet ecosystem.  These \\ngovernments will be closely watching this proceeding as it unfolds in the United States.  Cisco \\nemphasized that the \\u201cspecialized services\\u201d exemption was an extremely important component of \\nthe balance struck by Commission\\u2019s 2010 Open Internet Order, and should be retained in any \\nfuture regime.  Further, Cisco urged the Commission not to pursue a constricting definition of \\n\\u201cspecialized services.\\u201d  Rather, in order to accommodate the quickly evolving and still-nascent \\nmarket for managed offerings, the Commission should focus on an approach that promotes the \\ndevelopment and deployment of specialized services that will benefit consumers without \\nimpacting broadband Internet access services.  Finally, Cisco discussed an approach under which \\n\\u201cspecialized services\\u201d might be defined to include any IP-based services that are not broadband \\nInternet access service.  Cisco stated that this approach could be workable so long as it was \\napplied flexibly to accommodate ongoing technological and market developments.  \\nRespectfully submitted, \\n /s/ Russell P. Hanser  \\nRussell P. Hanser\", \n",

A physical facilities-based \\nnetwork capable of transmitting real time signals with formats unchanged that is managed, \\noperated, and maintained by the service provider to ensure service quality  and reliability from \\nthe subscriber location to public switched telephone network (PSTN) interconnection points or \\nother MFVN peer networks. (SIG-SSS) \\nA.3.3.152 Managed Facilities-Based Voice Network (MFVN). Managed facilities-based voice \\nnetwork service is functionally equivalent to traditional PSTN-based services provided by \\nauthorized common carriers (public utility telephone companies) with respect to dialing, dial \\nplan, call completion, carriage of signals and protocols, and loop voltage treatment and provides \\nall of the following features:\\n(1) A loop start telephone circuit service interface. \\n(2) Pathway reliability that is assured by proactive management, operation, and \\nmaintenance by the MFVN provider. \\n(3) 8 hours of standby power supply capacity for MFVN communications equipment \\neither located at the protected premises or field deployed. Industry standards followed by \\nthe authorized common carriers (public utility telephone companies), and the other \\ncommunications service providers that operate MFVNs, specifically engineer the \\nselection of the size of the batteries, or other permanently located standby power source, \\nin order to provide 8 hours of standby power with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Of \\ncourse, over time, abnormal ambient conditions and battery aging can always have a \\npotentially adverse effect on battery capacity. The MFVN field-deployed equipment \\ntypically monitors the condition of the standby battery and signals potential battery \\nfailure to permit the communications service provider to take appropriate action.\\n(4) 24 hours of standby power supply capacity for MFVN communications equipment \\nlocated at the communication service provider\\u2019s central office. \\n(5) Installation of network equipment at the protected premises with safeguards to \\nprevent unauthorized access to the equipment and its connections.  \\nWhen providing telephone service to a new customer, MFVN providers give notice to the \\ntelephone service subscriber of the need to have any connected alarm system tested by \\nauthorized fire alarm service personnel in accordance with Chapter 14 to make certain that all \\nsignal transmission features have remained operational. These features include the proper \\nfunctioning of line seizure and the successful transmission of signals to the supervising station. \\nIn this way, the MFVN providers assist their new customers in complying with a testing \\n\\nReproduced with permission from NFPA 72\\u00ae-2013, National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code, Copyright \\n\\u00a9 2012, National Fire Protection, Quincy, MA.

In the last 25 years, telephone service \\nproviders have introduced a variety of technologies to transport multiple, simultaneous telephone \\ncalls over shared communication\\u2019s pathways. In order to facilitate the further development of the \\nmodernization of the telephone network, the authorized common carriers (public utility \\ntelephone companies) have transitioned their equipment into a managed facilities-based voice \\nnetwork (MFVN) capable of providing a variety of communications services in addition to the \\nprovision of traditional telephone service.  \\nSimilarly, the evolution of digital communications technology has permitted entities other than \\nthe authorized common carriers (public utility telephone companies) to deploy robust \\ncommunications networks and offer a variety of communications services, including telephone \\nservice.  \\nThese alternate service providers fall into two broad categories. The first category includes those \\nentities that have emulated the MFVN provided by the authorized common carriers. The second \\ncategory includes those entities that offer telephone service using means that do not offer the \\nrigorous quality assurance, operational stability, and consistent features provided by an MFVN.  \\nThe Code intends to only recognize the use of the telephone network transmission of alarm, \\nsupervisory, trouble, and other emergency signals by means of MFVNs.  \\nFor example, the Code intends to permit an MFVN to provide facilities-based telephone (voice) \\nservice that interfaces with the premises fire alarm or emergency signal control unit through a \\ndigital alarm communicator transmitter (DACT) using a loop start telephone circuit and signaling \\nprotocols fully compatible with and equivalent to those used in public switched telephone \\nnetworks. The loop start telephone circuit and associated signaling can be provided through \\ntraditional copper wire telephone service (POTS\\u2014\\u201cplain old telephone service\\u201d) or by means of \\nequipment that emulates the loop start telephone circuit and associated signaling and then \\ntransmits the signals over a pathway using packet switched (IP) networks or other \\ncommunications methods that are part of an MFVN.  \\nProviders of MFVNs have disaster recovery plans to address both individual customer outages \\nand widespread events such as tornados, ice storms, or other natural disasters, which include \\nspecific network power restoration procedures equivalent to those of traditional landline \\ntelephone services.\", \n",

External Affairs Director Andrew MacFarlane and undersigned counsel attended for the \\ncompanies.  \\n The purpose of the meeting was to briefly review the events and actions giving rise to the \\nPublic Notice establishing GN Docket No. 14-28, describe how the issues impact the companies, \\nand for the companies to make preliminary recommendations on how to proceed. The companies \\ndistributed the attached document that served as the basis for discussion during the meeting. \\n   \\n       Sincerely, \\n       W. Scott McCollough \\n       Counsel \\n \\n\\n  \\n \\n \\nPROTECT THE OPEN INTERNET BY RETURNING TO COMMON CARRIER FOR \\nTRANSMISSION \\n \\n \\nThere is little to no competition for broadband transmission facilities used to offer service \\nto the public. In most places there are only one or two \\u201cwireline\\u201d broadband providers. The cost \\nof constructing duplicative ubiquitous facilities poses high economic and regulatory barriers to \\nnew entry. \\nA mistaken change in regulatory policy beginning in 1998 allowed cable and then fiber \\ntransmission providers to bundle transmission and higher-layer functions into a single product \\nand thereby escape regulation.  This led inexorably to the removal of telephone company \\ntransmission as a reasonably-available, stand-alone service or facility. As a result, the dominant \\nproviders have been able to leverage their market power over the \\u201ctransmission\\u201d market into the \\nlogically separate and adjacent \\u201cInternet access\\u201d market. They then have the incentive to block, \\ndegrade, discriminate or control prices for access to and use of unaffiliated applications, services \\nand content sources on the Internet as a means to extract monopoly rents from both markets. \\nThe FCC\\u2019s last effort (Net Neutrality) suffered from three defects. First, it was premised \\non an acceptance of duopoly conditions and the bundling they allowed. Net Neutrality merely \\ntried to ameliorate some of the downside effects. Second, it created other problems. Among other \\nthings, it functionally required the broadband provider to inspect content and determine what \\napplication was being used in order to implement the nondiscrimination and no blocking \\nmandates. Finally, as held by the D.C. Circuit, it does not comport with the Communications \\nAct. \\n\\u201cNet Neutrality\\u201d is not \\u201cOpen Internet.\\u201d The FCC must admit the errors committed by \\npast administrations and reinstate Computer Inquiry and 251(c) \\u201cOpen Access\\u201d unbundling and \\ninterconnection rules on ILECs and their functional equivalent in broadband, the cable operators. \\nOpen Access was in place for over 20 years and led to the creation of a vibrant and \\ncompetitive market in both long distance and \\u201cenhanced services.\\u201d Without this policy the \\nInternet would have not emerged and thrived. The FCC (and the states in tandem) should return \\nto the successful policy of requiring dominant transmission facilities owners to offer stand-alone \\nraw transmission on a common carrier basis. Regulators should (1) re-institute the Computer \\nInquiry regime of unbundled transmission for all facility based providers; (2) engage in a \\n\\u00a7251(h) proceeding to decide whether cable companies\\u2019 operations should be treated as \\nincumbent local exchange carriers; and (3) reconsider whether broadband transmission links \\nshould be brought back into the \\u00a7251(c)(3) UNE regime. \\nThe current discussion suggests that the FCC may impose common carrier regulation on \\n\\u201cInternet access.\\u201d This is a mistake, for several legal and technical reasons. Internet access can \\nbe competitive, and does not need to be regulated. Transmission is the bottleneck and that is \\nwhat must be returned to Title II treatment. The entire purpose of Computer Inquiry and the 1996 \\namendments was to isolate the essential transmission (\\u201ctelecommunications\\u201d) \\u201cbuilding blocks\\u201d, \\nand regulate them, while deregulating potentially competitive services that rely on transmission. \\nThe FCC does not need to regulate \\u201cthe Internet\\u201d; it just needs to reinstitute the Open Access \\nrules that prevailed for more than 20 years prior to 2001.\", \n",

(\\u201cSouthern\\u201d), on behalf of itself and its electric utility \\noperating affiliates, hereby submits its comments in response to the Notice of Proposed \\nRulemaking in the above-captioned matter.1 Southern urges the Commission to consider the \\nneeds of critical infrastructure industries, such as electric utilities, for reliable and predictable \\nlevels of Internet service, both for routine operations and for emergency operations during or \\nfollowing catastrophic events. In particular, Southern requests the Commission to clarify that \\nprioritization for emergency communications may include services needed by critical \\ninfrastructure industries to promote public safety and welfare. \\nBy way of introduction, Southern Company Services, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary \\nservice company of Southern Company, a super-regional energy company in the Southeast \\nUnited States.  Southern Company also owns four electric utility subsidiaries \\u2013 Alabama Power \\nCompany, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company, and Mississippi Power Company \\u2013 \\nwhich provide retail and wholesale electric service throughout a 120,000 square mile service \\n                                                 \\n1 In the Matter of Protecting and Preserving the Open Internet, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, \\n29 FCC Rcd 5561 (2014) (\\u201cNPRM\\u201d). The Comment deadline was extended to July 18, 2014, by \\nPublic Notice, DA 14-1002, released July 15, 2014. \\n\\n2 \\n \\nterritory in Georgia, most of Alabama, and parts of Florida and Mississippi. Members of the \\nSouthern Company family use a variety of communications technologies to support the safe and \\nefficient delivery of energy services to their customers. Southern has significant interest in \\nensuring that broadband or other communications networks used to support \\u201cSmart Grid\\u201d and \\nother utility-related communications requirements are reliable and secure. Southern therefore \\nappreciates the opportunity to address the issues raised by the Commission in the NPRM. \\n \\nI.  Background and Introduction \\n Southern submitted comments and reply comments in the 2010 Open Internet proceeding \\nlimited to whether Southern could obtain \\u201cmanaged\\u201d or \\u201cspecialized services\\u201d having consistent \\nand enforceable quality of service that would not be adversely impacted by the network \\noperator\\u2019s provision of broadband Internet access service to the public.2 Southern expressed \\nconcern that unless the rules for specialized services were clarified large enterprise users such as \\nSouthern would be very reluctant to rely on public broadband networks for critical applications. \\nSouthern explained that the best-efforts standard for broadband Internet access would not be \\nacceptable for many utility applications such as load management, protective relaying, and \\nsupervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA). Southern also filed a \\u201cPetition for \\nClarification or Reconsideration\\u201d of the 2010 Open Internet Order, requesting the Commission \\n                                                 \\n2  Preserving the Open Internet, GN Docket No. 09-191, WC Docket No. 07-52, Report and \\nOrder, 25 FCC Rcd 17905 (2010 Open Internet Order), aff\\u2019d in part, vacated and remanded in \\npart sub nom. Verizon v. FCC, 740 F.3d 623 (D.C. Cir. 2014). \\n\\n3 \\n \\nto reconcile certain statements in the order that implied that certain specialized services might be \\nreclassified as broadband Internet access services and therefore subject to regulation.3 \\n  \\nII.   Emergency Prioritization \\n Section 8.9 of the Commission\\u2019s Rules, as adopted in the 2010 Open Internet Order, \\nprovided that nothing in the Open Internet rules would supersede \\u201cany obligation or \\nauthorization a provider of broadband Internet access service may have to address the needs of \\nemergency communications or law enforcement, public safety, or national security authorities, \\nconsistent with or as permitted by applicable law, or limits the provider\\u2019s ability to do so.\\u201d The \\nCommission is proposing to retain this rule without modification.4  \\nSouthern urges the Commission to modify this rule to permit prioritization of Internet \\naccess for critical infrastructure services during and following emergencies. The Commission has \\nin place other mechanisms to afford priority provisioning or restoration of services deemed to be \\nin the public interest, such as the Telecommunications Service Priority (\\u201cTSP\\u201d) system, the \\nWireless Priority Service (\\u201cWPS\\u201d), and the Government Emergency Telecommunications \\nService (\\u201cGETS\\u201d). Critical telecommunications services used by utilities are eligible for TSP \\nservice because utilities support \\u201cpublic health, safety, and maintenance of law and order \\nactivities,\\u201d and \\u201cmaintain the public welfare and the national economic system.\\u201d5 The TSP \\nsystem recognizes that utilities use \\u201cNational Security Emergency Preparedness\\u201d (NSEP) \\ntelecommunications services, which are defined as telecommunication services \\u201cused to maintain \\n                                                 \\n3 Because of the judicial review of the 2010 Open Internet Order the Commission never acted \\nupon Southern\\u2019s Petition for Clarification or Reconsideration. \\n4 NPRM, para. 160. \\n5 47 C.F.R. Part 54, Appendix A, Section 12(c)(3) and (4). \\n\\n4 \\n \\na state of readiness or to respond to and manage any event or crisis (local, national, or \\ninternational), which causes or could cause injury or harm to the population, damage to or loss of \\nproperty, or degrades or threatens the NSEP posture of the United States.\\u201d6 \\nThe TSP system was adopted so that communications common carriers could lawfully \\nprovide priority service to certain users without violating the prohibitions on discriminatory or \\npreferential treatment in Section 202 of the Communications Act.7 The Commission granted \\nsimilar protections from liability under Section 202 to wireless carriers electing to provide \\n\\u201cPriority Access Service\\u201d (now called WPS), including priority service to non-government \\nNSEP personnel such as utilities.8 \\nEven though the FCC is not proposing to apply common carrier requirements to \\nbroadband Internet service providers neither should it prohibit Internet service providers from \\naffording preferential treatment to utilities or others that support the nation\\u2019s critical \\ninfrastructure. Such a prohibition would turn the public interest standard on its head by \\nforbidding information service providers from giving preferential treatment for NSEP-type \\nservices even though more heavily regulated common carriers are permitted and indeed, \\nencouraged or required, to offer such prioritization in the interest of the public safety and \\n                                                 \\n6 47 C.F.R. Part 64, Appendix A, Section 3(f). \\n7 In the Matter of National Security Emergency Preparedness Telecommunications Service \\nPriority System, GEN Docket No. 87-505, Order, 3 FCC Rcd 6650 (1988).  \\n8 In the Matter of The Development of Operational, Technical and Spectrum Requirements for \\nMeeting Federal, State and Local Public Safety Agency Communication Requirements Through \\nthe Year 2010; Establishment of Rules and Requirements for Priority Access Service, WT \\nDocket No. 96-86, Second Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd 16720 (2000). Utilities are eligible \\nfor \\u201cPriority 4\\u201d in the WPS, as \\u201cusers whose responsibilities include managing public works and \\nutility infrastructure damage assessment and restoration efforts and transportation to accomplish \\nemergency response activities. Examples of those eligible include (i) Army Corps of Engineers \\nleadership; (ii) Power, water and sewage and telecommunications utilities; and (iii) \\nTransportation leadership.\\u201d 47 C.F.R. Part 64, Appendix B, Section 5(D). \\n\\n5 \\n \\nwelfare.9 The Commission recently noted that the transition to all-Internet Protocol (IP) networks \\nmust not threaten safety of life and national security communications, so it is important that the \\nrules adopted in this proceeding afford utilities and others supporting NSEP functions the same \\nprioritization of service.10 \\nSouthern therefore recommends that proposed Section 8.9 be modified as follows: \\n\\u00a78.9  Other Laws and Considerations \\nNothing in this part supersedes any obligation, or authorization, or right a provider of \\nbroadband Internet access service may have to address the needs of emergency \\ncommunications or law enforcement, public safety, or national security, or public \\nutilitiesauthorities, consistent with or as permitted by applicable law, or limits the \\nprovider\\u2019s ability to do so.  \\n \\n* * * \\n \\nIII. Conclusion \\n Section 1 of the Communications Act directs the Commission to regulate interstate and \\nforeign commerce in communication so as to make available, without discrimination, a rapid and \\nefficient communication service \\u201cwith adequate facilities at reasonable charges, for the purpose \\n                                                 \\n9  In connection with the TSP service, the Common Carrier Bureau, acting on explicit delegated \\nauthority, stated that if a network provider is not a common carrier but makes a decision to carry \\ntraffic for a common carrier, the provider must \\u201csubordinate, to the extent necessary, decisions \\nregarding private system restoration or provisioning to TSP System requirements. Any other \\ninterpretation would subrogate TSP to non-NSEP procedures and priorities and undermine the \\ngoals of the TSP process.\\u201d In the Matter of National Security Emergency Preparedness \\nTelecommunications Service Priority System, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 4 FCC Rcd \\n8473, 8477 (Com.Car. Bur. 1989). In the same way, the Commission should ensure that \\nprioritizations on IP networks do not interfere with communications that support NSEP \\nactivities, even if the underlying communications providers are not considered \\u201ccommon \\ncarriers\\u201d under the Communications Act. \\n10 In the Matter of Technology Transitions, GN Docket No. 13-5, et al., Order, Report and Order \\nand Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Report and Order, Order and Further Notice of \\nProposed Rulemaking, Proposal for Ongoing Data Initiative, 29 FCC Rcd 1433, 1446-48 \\n(2014). \\n\\n6 \\n \\nof the national defense,\\u201d and \\u201cfor the purpose of promoting safety of life and property through \\nthe use of wire and radio communication.\\u201d11 The nation\\u2019s public communications networks are \\nrapidly evolving to IP-based standards and more users are relying on the Internet to meet the \\nmajority of their communications requirements. Southern therefore requests that the Commission \\nspecifically allow and encourage prioritization of communications necessary to promote safety \\nof life and property and for the maintenance and restoration of the nation\\u2019s critical infrastructure.  \\n \\n WHEREFORE, THE PREMISES CONSIDERED, Southern Company Services, Inc. \\nrespectfully requests that the Commission adopt final rules in this docket consistent with the \\nviews expressed herein. \\nRespectfully submitted, \\n \\nSOUTHERN COMPANY SERVICES, INC.  \\n \\n \\n/s/  Jeffrey L.

Cir. 2014). \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n2 \\nI. OPEN INTERNET SAFEGUARDS REMAIN VITALLY IMPORTANT \\nAn open Internet is vital to innovation, economic growth, and free expression on the \\nInternet.  The Internet\\u2019s \\u201cinnovation without permission\\u201d ecosystem flows from a decentralized, \\nopen architecture, and creates an environment for Internet users to access content without \\nbarriers.  An open Internet also is essential to continued improvements and advancements to our \\nbroadband infrastructure.   \\nThe D.C. Circuit endorsed the Commission\\u2019s identification of a virtuous cycle of \\ninnovation in which \\u201cnew uses of the network\\u2014including new content, applications, services, \\nand devices\\u2014lead to increased end-user demand for broadband, which drives network \\nimprovements, which in turn lead to further innovative network uses.\\u201d5  \\nThe continued success of the Internet as a platform for innovation, speech, and commerce \\nshould not be taken for granted.  The D.C. Circuit agreed with the Commission\\u2019s conclusion that \\nthe gatekeeper terminating access position of broadband Internet access service (\\u201cBIAS\\u201d) \\nproviders means that they have both the \\u201ctechnological ability to distinguish between and \\ndiscriminate against certain types of Internet traffic\\u201d and a monopoly \\u201ceconomic power\\u201d that \\nincents them to \\u201crestrict edge-provider traffic\\u201d and discriminate against unaffiliated traffic.6  \\nAccordingly, the Commission should adopt enforceable rules to preserve the fundamental \\ncharacteristics of an open Internet.     \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                 \\n \\n5 Id. at 661 n.4.  \\n6 Id. at 646 (citing Open Internet Order, 25 FCC Rcd. at 17923 \\u00b6 31). \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n3 \\nII. THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS ENFORCEABLE RULES TO \\nPROTECT AN OPEN INTERNET \\nThe Internet Association encourages the Commission to pursue a sound, targeted strategy \\nto ensure an open Internet.  Among Section 706 and Titles II, III, and VI of the Communications \\nAct, the Commission has the authority it needs to protect an open Internet.  Using its authority, \\nthe Commission should ensure that it has in place enforceable rules ensuring transparency, \\nprohibiting blocking, and mandating non-discrimination. \\n Transparency.  The Internet Association supports a transparency rule that requires \\nInternet access providers to provide information regarding their network management practices, \\nperformance, and the commercial terms of their broadband services.  Users should know if BIAS \\nproviders are blocking and degrading content and any reasons for doing so.  Users should also \\nhave meaningful information about the performance of their broadband service: peak-time end-\\nto-end performance, rather than just aggregate speed from the home to the headend.  Consumers \\nare entitled to know whether their broadband connections can actually support the desirable \\ncontent and applications that motivated them to become broadband service subscribers in the \\nfirst place, or to upgrade their broadband service.  Further, edge providers should have the \\ntechnical information they need to create and maintain their products and services as well as to \\nassess the risks and benefits of embarking on new projects. \\nNo blocking.  The Internet Association supports an enforceable rule that precludes \\nInternet access providers from blocking or degrading access to content.  Users should be able to \\nreach any sites that they want and retrieve the information and content they request.  And edge \\nproviders should not be unfairly blocked, explicitly or implicitly, from reaching consumers.  The \\nfundamental architecture of the Internet depends on this basic rule. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n4 \\nNon-discrimination.  Chairman Wheeler has proposed setting \\u201can enforceable legal \\nstandard that provides guidance and predictability to edge providers, consumers, and broadband \\nproviders alike to use with a case-by-case approach to address instances of discrimination.\\u201d7  A \\ncase-by-case approach works best if there are clear rules establishing the forms of discrimination \\nthat are not permissible on the Internet.  Indeed, clear rules are a legal prerequisite for case-by-\\ncase enforcement.  \\nThe transparency, non-blocking, and non-discrimination rules should apply to both the \\nwired and wireless environments.  Wireless broadband is no longer the fledgling platform that it \\nwas at the start of the FCC\\u2019s Open Internet proceeding and new companies that are excluded \\nfrom mobile broadband will not be able to compete fairly or effectively. \\nIII.   INTERCONNECTION  \\n \\nToday broadband Internet access service providers may exert influence as gatekeepers \\nbetween edge providers and their customers.  This is a consequence of the broadband Internet \\naccess service providers\\u2019 \\u201clast mile\\u201d position in the way Internet access is delivered.  The \\nInternet Association believes that the entire industry (ISPs, CDNs, application providers, etc.) \\nshould aspire to \\u201csettlement-free\\u201d peering because that outcome ultimately benefits all \\nstakeholders in the Internet ecosystem. \\n \\nIV. CONCLUSION \\n The Internet Association is encouraged by Chairman Wheeler\\u2019s decision to make \\npreserving an open Internet a core priority for the Commission.  The Internet Association hopes \\nthat the opening of this docket will help maintain focus on that priority.  Adherence to basic \\n                                                 \\n \\n7 FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, Statement on the FCC\\u2019s Open Internet Rules (Feb. 19, 2014). \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n5 \\nprinciples of openness will ensure that innovation and competition continue to thrive on the \\nInternet.   \\n \\n \\nRespectfully submitted, \\n/s/        \\n     Michael Beckerman \\n     President & CEO \\n     The Internet Association \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nApril 3, 2014\", \n",

The Internet now \\nserves as a primary, open platform for information exchange, intellectual discourse, civic \\nengagement, creativity, research, innovation, teaching, and learning.  We are deeply concerned \\nthat public broadband providers have financial incentives to interfere with the openness of the \\nInternet and may act on these incentives in ways that could be harmful to the Internet content and \\nservices provided by libraries and educational institutions. Preserving the unimpeded flow of \\ninformation over the public Internet and ensuring equitable access for all people is critical to our \\nnation\\u2019s social, cultural, educational, and economic well-being. \\nOur organizations have joined together to provide the following background information and to \\nset forth the key principles (below) that we believe the Federal Communications Commission \\n(FCC) should adopt as it reconsiders its \\u201cnet neutrality\\u201d policies in response to the recent court \\ndecision.  We invite others to join us. \\nBackground: The FCC opened a new proceeding on \\u201cnet neutrality\\u201d in May 2014 (Docket No. \\n14-28).  This proceeding is in response to a January 2014 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals \\u2013 \\nD.C. Circuit that overturned two of the FCC\\u2019s key \\u201cnet neutrality\\u201d rules but affirmed the FCC\\u2019s \\n\\nauthority under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act to regulate broadband access to the \\nInternet. The new FCC proceeding will explore what \\u201cnet neutrality\\u201d policies it can and should \\nadopt in the wake of the court\\u2019s ruling.   \\nThe above organizations support the FCC\\u2019s adoption of \\u201cnet neutrality\\u201d policies to ensure that \\nthe Internet remains open to free speech, research, education and innovation.  We believe that \\nInternet Service Providers (ISPs) should operate their networks in a neutral manner without \\ninterfering with the transmission, services, applications, or content of Internet communications.  \\nInternet users often assume (and may take for granted) that the Internet is inherently an open and \\nunbiased platform, but there is no law or regulation in effect today that requires ISPs to be \\nneutral.  ISPs can act as gatekeepers\\u2014they can give enhanced or favorable transmission to some \\nInternet traffic, block access to certain web sites or applications, or otherwise discriminate \\nagainst certain Internet services for their own commercial reasons, or for any reason at all.   \\nThe above organizations are especially concerned that ISPs have financial incentives to provide \\nfavorable Internet service to certain commercial Internet companies or customers, thereby \\ndisadvantaging nonprofit or public entities such as colleges, universities and libraries.  For \\ninstance, ISPs could sell faster or prioritized transmission to certain entities (\\u201cpaid \\nprioritization\\u201d), or they could degrade Internet applications that compete with the ISPs\\u2019 own \\nservices.  Libraries and higher education institutions that cannot afford to pay extra fees could be \\nrelegated to the \\u201cslow lane\\u201d on the Internet.   \\nTo be clear, the above organizations do not object to paying for higher-capacity connections to \\nthe Internet; once connected, however, users should not have to pay additional fees to receive \\nprioritized transmission and their Internet messages or services should not be blocked or \\ndegraded. Such discrimination or degradation could jeopardize education, research, learning, and \\nthe unimpeded flow of information. \\nFor these reasons, the above organizations believe that the FCC should adopt enforceable \\npolicies based on the following principles to protect the openness of the Internet:   \\n \\n  \\n\\nNet Neutrality Principles \\n\\u0673 Ensure Neutrality on All Public Networks: Neutrality is an essential characteristic of \\npublic broadband Internet access.  The principles that follow must apply to all broadband \\nproviders and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) who provide service to the general public, \\nregardless of underlying transmission technology (e.g., wireline or wireless) and regardless of \\nlocal market conditions.  \\n\\u0673 Prohibit Blocking:  ISPs and public broadband providers should not be permitted to \\nblock access to legal web sites, resources, applications, or Internet-based services. \\n\\u0673 Protect Against Unreasonable Discrimination: Every person in the United States \\nshould be able to access legal content, applications, and services over the Internet, without \\n\\u201cunreasonable discrimination\\u201d by the owners and operators of public broadband networks and \\nISPs.  This will ensure that ISPs do not give favorable transmission to their affiliated content \\nproviders or discriminate against particular Internet services based on the identity of the user, the \\ncontent of the information, or the type of service being provided.  \\u201cUnreasonable discrimination\\u201d \\nis the standard in Title II of the Communications Act; the FCC has generally applied this \\nstandard to instances in which providers treat similar customers in significantly different ways. \\n\\u0673 Prohibit Paid Prioritization:  Public broadband providers and ISPs should not be \\npermitted to sell prioritized  transmission to certain content, applications, and service providers \\nover other Internet traffic sharing the same network facilities.  Prioritizing certain Internet traffic \\ninherently disadvantages other content, applications, and service providers\\u2014including those \\nfrom higher education and libraries that serve vital public interests. \\n\\u0673 Prevent Degradation: Public broadband providers and ISPs should not be permitted to \\ndegrade the transmission of Internet content, applications, or service providers, either \\nintentionally or by failing to invest in adequate broadband capacity to accommodate reasonable \\ntraffic growth.   \\n\\u0673 Enable Reasonable Network Management: Public broadband network operators and \\nISPs should be able to engage in reasonable network management to address issues such as \\ncongestion, viruses, and spam as long as such actions are consistent with these principles. \\nPolicies and procedures should ensure that legal network traffic is managed in a content-neutral \\nmanner. \\n\\u0673 Provide Transparency: Public broadband network operators and ISPs should disclose \\nnetwork management practices publicly and in a manner that 1) allows users as well as content, \\napplication, and service providers to make informed choices; and 2) allows policy-makers to \\ndetermine whether the practices are consistent with these network neutrality principles.  This rule \\ndoes not require disclosure of essential proprietary information or information that jeopardizes \\nnetwork security. \\n\\n\\u0673  Continue Capacity-Based Pricing of Broadband Internet Access Connections:  \\nPublic broadband providers and ISPs may continue to charge consumers and content, \\napplication, and service providers for their broadband connections to the Internet, and may \\nreceive greater compensation for greater capacity chosen by the consumer or content, \\napplication, and service provider.  \\n\\u0673 Adopt Enforceable Policies:  Policies and rules to enforce these principles should be \\nclearly stated and transparent.  Any public broadband provider or ISP that is found to have \\nviolated these policies or rules should be subject to penalties, after being adjudicated on a case-\\nby-case basis.   \\n\\u0673 Accommodate Public Safety:  Reasonable accommodations to these principles can be \\nmade based on evidence that such accommodations are necessary for public safety, health, law \\nenforcement, national security, or emergency situations. \\n\\u0673 Maintain the Status Quo on Private Networks: Owners and operators of private \\nnetworks that are not openly available to the general public should continue to operate according \\nto the long-standing principle and practice that private networks are not subject to regulation. \\nEnd users (such as households, companies, coffee shops, schools, or libraries) should be free to \\ndecide how they use the broadband services they obtain from network operators and ISPs. \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n\\nAbout the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) \\n \\nThe American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) is the primary advocacy \\norganization for the nation\\u2019s community colleges.
