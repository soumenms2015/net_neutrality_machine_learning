EXPERT	10-127      COMMENTS OF   THE NATIONAL CABLE & TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION   The National Cable & Telecommunications Association (\u201cNCTA\u201d) submits these  comments in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking adopted and released on May 15,  2014 and the Public Notice released on May 30, 2014 in the above-captioned proceedings.1  INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY   This rulemaking\u2014prompted by the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in Verizon v. FCC to vacate  significant portions of the Commission\u2019s 2010 Open Internet Order2\u2014presents the Commission  with an important opportunity to reframe its open Internet rules in a manner that both comports  with governing law and advances the policy goals of promoting Internet openness and  encouraging continued investment in and deployment of broadband networks.
EXPERT	NCTA stands  ready to work closely with the Commission on accomplishing these important objectives.
EXPERT	As discussed below, the Internet has experienced unprecedented growth in recent years  while the Commission generally has pursued a policy of \u201cvigilant restraint\u201d in the regulation of                                                    1   Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet, GN Docket No.

EXPERT	2    broadband Internet access service.
EXPERT	The Commission has rightly rejected calls to impose overly  burdensome and prescriptive mandates on broadband Internet service providers (\u201cISPs\u201d)\u2014most  notably by adopting and then repeatedly reaffirming its classification of broadband Internet  access service as an \u201cinformation service,\u201d thus precluding the imposition of common-carrier  obligations under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cAct\u201d).
EXPERT	Thanks  to the Commission\u2019s light regulatory touch, consumers have reaped the benefits of staggering  levels of private investment in broadband networks and technologies.
EXPERT	In turn, these private  investments have prompted the rise of new applications and services that can take advantage of  the ever-improving broadband infrastructure.
EXPERT	The Verizon court set forth a relatively simple and straightforward roadmap for the  Commission to adopt new rules under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996\u2014 rules that will advance the Commission\u2019s policy objectives while avoiding the unwise and  unlawful imposition of common-carrier obligations on providers of broadband Internet access  service.
EXPERT	The NPRM appropriately focuses on proposals that would follow the path laid out by  the Verizon court.
EXPERT	Nevertheless, the NPRM also unnecessarily and troublingly strays from that  path in a number of respects\u2014most notably by reopening the possibility of reclassifying  broadband Internet access service as a Title II telecommunications service, and by otherwise  proposing to expand on the previously adopted rules in ways that would do more harm than  good.
EXPERT	The Commission now stands at a crossroads, and the continued vibrancy of the Internet is  at stake.
EXPERT	As a threshold matter, the Commission should steer clear of pursuing a Title II  reclassification theory in adopting any new rules.
EXPERT	The Commission\u2019s consistent, fact-based, and  judicially validated findings that broadband Internet access service is properly classified as an   3    information service were the product of bipartisan consensus and have fueled the unprecedented  growth and dynamism of the Internet.
EXPERT	The last thing the Commission should do is to jettison that  established classification and start over by introducing heavy-handed common-carrier regulation  under Title II.
EXPERT	Such an approach would be a disastrous policy reversal.
EXPERT	Title II reclassification  not only is unnecessary to achieve the Commission\u2019s policy objectives, but would affirmatively  undermine those objectives by significantly deterring the ongoing investments necessary to  deploy broadband further and support the Internet\u2019s continuing evolution.
EXPERT	Moreover, as a legal  matter, such an approach would impermissibly ignore the \u201cfactual particulars\u201d of broadband  Internet access service and trample on broadband providers\u2019 reliance interests, and thus would  present a serious risk of being set aside by a reviewing court.
EXPERT	After two court reversals of the  Commission\u2019s attempts to establish binding open Internet rules, it would make no sense to  eschew the clear guidance provided by the D.C.
EXPERT	Circuit in order to pursue a risky and  destabilizing reclassification strategy.
EXPERT	The Commission also should reject the latest twists on  Title II regulation floated in the NPRM, such as the proposal to separate out and reclassify  \u201cremote delivery services\u201d that ISPs purportedly provide to edge providers, and the proposal to  rely on a so-called \u201cspringing Title II\u201d theory to deter legal challenges to the rules.
EXPERT	Moreover, the Commission should ensure that the new rules adopted under Section 706  do not thwart the very innovation and deployment that the Commission seeks to promote.
EXPERT	The  current transparency regime is sufficient to ensure that the marketplace disciplines conduct that  conflicts with core values of Internet openness, and there is no basis to conclude that enhanced  transparency rules are needed.
EXPERT	To the contrary, several of the contemplated expansions to the  transparency regime would impose significant, unwarranted burdens on broadband providers  without meaningfully helping consumers.
EXPERT	In addition, any new no-blocking rules must adhere to   4    the limitations identified by the Verizon court and should avoid dictating what minimum levels  of service would be deemed \u201ceffectively usable\u201d for purposes of the rule; indeed, market forces  obviate the need for such a prescriptive mandate.
EXPERT	By the same token, it is likely premature for  the Commission to impose \u201ccommercial reasonableness\u201d obligations on ISPs when engaging in  individualized negotiations with edge providers, and the Commission certainly should not adopt  an outright ban on all \u201cpaid prioritization\u201d arrangements between edge providers and broadband  ISPs unless and until the benefits and potential harms of such arrangements are fully understood.
EXPERT	The Commission also should ensure that any enforcement mechanisms it adopts are efficient and  fair.
EXPERT	Just as important as getting the substance of the rules right is ensuring that their scope is  appropriately tailored to the policy interests at stake.
EXPERT	In particular, the Commission should  harmonize its regulatory treatment of fixed and mobile broadband providers.
EXPERT	While it is  questionable whether there was ever a legitimate basis to subject fixed and mobile broadband  providers to differential regulatory burdens, there is plainly no factual or legal basis to do so in  today\u2019s increasingly competitive marketplace.
EXPERT	The Commission also should address the fact that  ISPs do not entirely control the consumer Internet experience and that edge providers,  particularly \u201chyper-giant\u201d edge providers, can have a significant impact on consumers\u2019 access to  Internet content and services.
EXPERT	To the extent the Commission is concerned that consumers\u2019 access  to online content and services could be blocked or degraded, it makes no sense to focus  exclusively on Internet access providers and ignore conduct by edge providers that threatens  similar harms.
EXPERT	By contrast, as the NPRM tentatively concludes, the Commission should reject  calls to expand the scope of any new rules to arrangements and services that do not involve the  provision of broadband Internet access service to end users, such as commercially negotiated   5    peering and other traffic-exchange arrangements and so-called \u201cspecialized services.\u201d  And in  adopting any new rules, the Commission should make clear that states are preempted from  imposing overlapping and potentially conflicting open Internet requirements.
EXPERT	As is always the case whenever the Commission considers new rules for the Internet, the  Commission has been bombarded with apocalyptic predictions that the vibrancy of the Internet  will somehow be destroyed unless the Commission subjects providers of broadband Internet  access service to more heavy-handed regulation.
EXPERT	But the dynamism of the broadband  marketplace, fostered by the Commission\u2019s consistent policy of avoiding the imposition of  unduly burdensome regulations on the Internet ecosystem, has proven these naysayers wrong  every time.
EXPERT	Advocacy groups darkly warned in 1998 that the entry of cable operators into the  broadband marketplace would, \u201cquite literally, change the character of the Internet as an engine  of creative technological and marketplace innovation, open entry, economic growth, and free  expression.\u201d3  But as the NPRM recognizes, \u201cthe Internet has been, and remains to date, the  preeminent 21st century engine for innovation and the economic and social benefits that  follow.\u201d4  Others grimly predicted in the late 1990s that \u201c[i]f the Commission [took] no action at  [that] time, .

EXPERT	In short, proponents of overly invasive  broadband regulation have cried wolf before; the Commission has declined to credit these  predictions in the past, and should continue to do so in crafting appropriately tailored rules for  the 21st-century broadband marketplace.
EXPERT	DISCUSSION  I.
EXPERT	THE INTERNET HAS FLOURISHED UNDER A LIGHT REGULATORY  TOUCH   The Commission\u2019s longstanding classification of broadband Internet access service as an  \u201cinformation service\u201d\u2014and the light regulatory touch that has accompanied that classification\u2014 has allowed the Internet to grow and prosper, nourished by private investment.
EXPERT	For nearly two  decades, the Commission rightly and repeatedly has rejected calls to subject broadband Internet  access to the sort of heavy-handed, innovation-squelching, common-carrier regulation under  Title II of the Act that has traditionally applied to public utilities.7  Instead, through Democratic  and Republican administrations alike, the Commission has consistently concluded as a factual  and legal matter that broadband Internet access service is properly classified as a Title I  \u201cinformation service\u201d not subject to the onerous regulatory burdens imposed on  telecommunications carriers.
EXPERT	The Commission\u2019s bipartisan treatment of Internet access as an information service has  yielded overwhelming benefits for American consumers.
EXPERT	Chairman Kennard remarked at the                                                    6   Consumers Union Petition to Deny at 14-15 (internal quotation marks and alterations  omitted).
EXPERT	7   See Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, Report to Congress, 13 FCC Rcd  11501 P 46 (1998) (\u201c1998 Report to Congress\u201d) (declining to subject information service  providers to common carrier regulation under Title II).
EXPERT	7    dawn of the broadband era that, \u201cwith competition and deregulation as our touchstones, the FCC  has taken a hands-off, deregulatory approach to the broadband market,\u201d and that \u201cthe  marketplace has responded with enormous investment\u201d in broadband services for consumers.8   More than a decade later, the Commission\u2019s National Broadband Plan found that \u201cthe American  broadband ecosystem has evolved rapidly,\u201d and that this evolution has been \u201c[f]ueled primarily  by private sector investment and innovation\u201d with \u201climited\u201d government oversight.9  And today,  it is more apparent than ever that the Commission\u2019s light regulatory touch with regard to  broadband Internet access service has been a resounding success.
EXPERT	Indeed, under this market- oriented framework, broadband has become the fastest growing and most transformative  technology in history.
EXPERT	The Commission\u2019s restrained approach has spurred unprecedented levels of investment in  our nation\u2019s broadband infrastructure in recent years.
EXPERT	Broadband providers in the U.S. have  invested an astounding $1.2 trillion in private capital since 1996 to develop and deploy advanced  broadband networks.10  Over the past two decades, the broadband industry has invested an  average of $70 billion a year in our nation\u2019s wired and wireless broadband networks.11  And this                                                    8   Remarks by FCC Chairman William E.

EXPERT	11   See USTelecom, Updated Capital Spending Data Shows Rising Broadband Investment in  Nation\u2019s Information Infrastructure, Nov. 4, 2013, at 2, available at   8    investment is only accelerating; in fact, since 2012, broadband providers in the United States  have laid more high-speed fiber cables than in any similar period since 2000.12  The upshot has  been the creation of networks that now fuel America\u2019s economic growth, facilitate civic  participation like never before, and enable a dizzying array of communications, entertainment,  and educational options.
EXPERT	In short, broadband providers\u2019 massive investment of private risk  capital has spurred the development of an Internet ecosystem that now occupies a central place in  our lives.
EXPERT	These sustained investments in broadband far outstrip the level of investment in other  industries.
EXPERT	A recent White House report found that just two broadband providers \u201caccount for  greater combined stateside investment than the top five oil/gas companies, and nearly four times  more than the big three auto companies combined.\u201d13  Moreover, in recent years, five of top 20  U.S. companies by capital expenditures have been broadband providers\u2014Verizon, AT&T,  Comcast, Sprint, and Time Warner Cable.14  Simply put, no industry has invested as much in  capital improvements over the past 15 years as the broadband industry, and if the current                                                                                                                                                                http://www.ustelecom.org/sites/default/files/documents/103113-capex-research-brief- v2.pdf.

EXPERT	These substantial capital expenditures over the years by our nation\u2019s ISPs\u2014buoyed by  the Commission\u2019s market-based approach to broadband Internet access services\u2014have  positioned the United States as a global leader in broadband investment.
EXPERT	America has only four  percent of the world\u2019s population yet is home to nearly 25 percent of global broadband  investment.15  Broadband providers in the United States are investing more than twice as much  as their counterparts in the European Union on a per-household basis.16  Moreover, as a share of  gross domestic product, our nation\u2019s broadband investment rate exceeds that of several E.U.
EXPERT	countries, including Italy, Germany, and France, as well as other highly developed countries like  Japan and Canada.17  As discussed further below, several analysts have directly linked the  superior levels of broadband investment in the U.S. to the Commission\u2019s restrained regulatory  approach as compared to the European model, which has treated broadband providers as public  utilities.18  Thus, while it has become fashionable in some circles to disparage U.S. broadband                                                    15   See Roslyn Layton, The European Union\u2019s Broadband Challenge, American Enterprise  Institute for Public Policy Research, at 2 (Feb. 2014), available at  http://www.aei.org/files/2014/02/18/-the-european-unions-broadband- challenge_175900142730.pdf (\u201cLayton Study\u201d); see also Roslyn Layton, When It Comes  To High-Speed Internet, The Grass Isn\u2019t Greener In Europe, Forbes, Feb. 7, 2014,  available at http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/02/07/when-it-comes-to-high- speed-internet-the-grass-isnt-greener-in-europe/ (\u201cLayton Article\u201d).

EXPERT	18   See, e.g., Yoo Study at 1 (\u201cDisparities between European and U.S. broadband networks  stemmed from differing regulatory approaches.
EXPERT	Europe has relied on regulations that treat  broadband as a public utility and focus on promoting service-based competition, in which  new entrants lease incumbents\u2019 facilities at wholesale cost (also known as unbundling).

EXPERT	The  Commission and NTIA reported that over 99 percent of the U.S. population has access to  broadband service with at least a 3 Mbps download speed and a 768 kilobit-per-second (kbps)  upload speed,25 and nearly 98 percent of the population has access to download speeds of at least  10 Mbps.26  Indeed, almost the same percentage of the population has access to 10 Mbps  download speeds today as had access to 3 Mbps speeds just two years ago.27  These speeds are  becoming increasingly consistent as well; according to a report released by the Commission this  June, ISPs on average are delivering 101 percent of advertised maximum download speeds  during peak usage hours, up from 80 percent in 2011.28                                                      23   FCC and NTIA, National Broadband Map: Broadband Statistics Report, at 4 (Feb.  2014), available at  http://www.broadbandmap.gov/download/Technology%20by%20Speed.pdf  (\u201cFCC/NTIA Feb. 2014 Report\u201d).

EXPERT	12     Here, too, the comparison to broadband service in other developed countries is  illuminating.
EXPERT	While, as noted above, 85 percent of the U.S. population now has access to  broadband networks capable of providing 100 Mbps speeds, \u201cjust over half of European homes  can access speeds of 30 Mbps or greater.\u201d29  Relatedly, while a dwindling number of  Americans\u2014only 34 percent\u2014continue to rely on traditional DSL service, 74 percent of  Europeans still do so.30  The U.S. also has \u201croughly twice the percentage of homes with access to  advanced fiber-optic networks as does the E.U.\u201d31\u2014a testament to the power of private  investment, unfettered by overly restrictive common-carrier regulation, to deliver rapidly  improving broadband service in response to consumer demand.
EXPERT	At the same time, the price for broadband service, as measured on a per-Mbps basis, has  decreased sharply in the United States in the last decade-plus.
EXPERT	For instance, Comcast recently  noted that, since 1996, the speed of connections offered under Comcast\u2019s standard broadband  Internet service tier has increased by approximately 900 percent, while the price that subscribers  to this service pay per Mbps has declined by at least 87 percent.32  Other broadband providers  have reported similar reductions in the price per Mbps for broadband service over the years.33  It  should therefore come as no surprise that broadband prices in the United States, like the  broadband speeds and investment levels discussed above, compare favorably to those found in  other highly developed nations.

EXPERT	Against this backdrop, broadband providers have every incentive to continue promoting  the open Internet in any way they can.
EXPERT	It would be irrational for broadband providers to  undermine the very openness that has long buoyed their businesses for some short-term gain, or  to block or degrade access to Internet content that competing providers make readily available.
EXPERT	Contrary to some extremists\u2019 apparent belief that broadband ISPs are bad actors bent on  destroying the Internet, broadband ISPs have powerful business incentives that are aligned with  the Commission\u2019s policy objectives.40  Indeed, as the Commission recognized in its 2010 Open  Internet Order, the very investment and innovation that the Commission seeks to promote is  driven, in the first instance, by \u201cincreased end-user demand for broadband\u201d41\u2014demand that  broadband providers have no interest in diminishing through the blocking of lawful Internet  content.
EXPERT	And given that the deployment of broadband networks entails the outlay of substantial  fixed costs, broadband providers have an economic imperative in today\u2019s marketplace to recoup  those costs by maximizing the usage of such networks\u2014and not to degrade the experience  provided over those networks.
EXPERT	Moreover, any suggestion that a cable operator offering broadband service might have an  incentive to degrade its customers\u2019 online experience in order to preserve its legacy video  revenues is fundamentally at odds with marketplace realities.
EXPERT	Cable operators\u2019 video businesses  are contributing less and less to the recovery of broadband costs\u2014the result of continuing                                                    40   See NPRM P 44 (asking whether \u201cbroadband providers today have economic incentives  and mechanisms to block or disadvantage a particular edge provider or class of edge  providers\u201d).

EXPERT	Even if broadband providers had an incentive to degrade their customers\u2019 online  experience in some circumstances, they have no practical ability to act on such an incentive.
EXPERT	Today\u2019s Internet ecosystem is dominated by a number of \u201chyper-giants\u201d with growing power  over key aspects of the Internet experience\u2014including Google in search, Netflix and Google  (YouTube) in online video, Amazon and eBay in e-commerce, and Facebook in social media.44                                                     42   See Annual Assessment for the Status of Competition in the Market for the Delivery of  Video Programming, Fifteenth Report, 28 FCC Rcd 10496 P 129 (2013) (finding that  \u201ccable MVPDs lost video subscribers and market share\u201d between 2010 and 2011 and  citing data indicating that this downward trend was continuing); Robin Flynn, SNL  Kagan, Special Report: U.S. Multichannel Subscriber Update and Programming Cost  Analysis at 3 (Jun.

EXPERT	Indeed, it is more likely that these large edge providers would seek to extract payment  from ISPs for delivery of video over last-mile networks.
EXPERT	Nor is there any realistic prospect that  ISPs would seek payment for prioritizing certain content over last-mile broadband Internet  access networks.
EXPERT	To NCTA\u2019s knowledge, no broadband provider is engaging in such activity or  plans to do so, even apart from the fact that edge providers appear highly unlikely to agree to  such payments.
EXPERT	Accordingly, consistent with broadband providers\u2019 long history of adhering to  openness and their firm commitments (backed by enforceable consumer disclosures) to preserve  the open Internet, they have neither the incentive nor any practical ability to block or degrade  access to online content and services.
EXPERT	II.
EXPERT	IMPOSING TITLE II REGULATION WOULD BE DISASTROUS AS A POLICY  MATTER AND UNTENABLE AS A LEGAL MATTER   In spite of this flourishing, dynamic, and competitive Internet ecosystem, the NPRM  alarmingly raises the specter of subjecting broadband to monopoly-style utility regulation under  Title II of the Act\u2014the very approach the Commission has consistently found would destroy the  Internet\u2019s dynamism, dramatically reduce investment and innovation, and derail the  Commission\u2019s broadband adoption and deployment goals.
EXPERT	Proponents of Title II regulation  largely view it as a way to address one aspect of one proposed rule: the treatment of \u201cpaid  prioritization\u201d arrangements for the delivery of edge-provider traffic over last-mile broadband  networks under a non-discrimination or \u201ccommercial reasonableness\u201d standard.
EXPERT	Setting aside the  fact that broadband providers have never entered into such arrangements and have expressed no                                                                                                                                                                Interconnection-EE-02.21.14.pdf (providing updated findings on power of \u201chyper-giants\u201d  over hosting and distribution of Internet content).
EXPERT	17    desire to do so, an approach that radically changes the regulatory model to Title II for such a  limited purpose would be akin to burning a house down to frighten a mouse away.
EXPERT	As explained  below, the putative benefits of such an approach are essentially zero, and the harms would be  monumental.
EXPERT	Reclassification also likely would be unlawful, given that the factual particulars of  broadband Internet access service have not materially changed since the Commission adopted  and then reaffirmed its current \u201cinformation service\u201d classification for this service.
EXPERT	For similar  legal and policy reasons, the Commission should not entertain the various back-door proposals  for importing Title II obligations into the broadband arena, such as the proposal to separate out  and classify the return-path element of broadband Internet access service under Title II, or the  proposal to adopt a Title II theory as a \u201cbackstop\u201d to rules adopted under Section 706 of the  Telecommunications Act.
EXPERT	Instead, the Commission should recognize that Title II does not offer  a viable regulatory approach in the broadband arena, close the pending proceeding devoted to  reclassification, and return to the more productive endeavor of considering possible regulatory  measures under Section 706, as prompted by the Verizon court.
EXPERT	A.
EXPERT	Subjecting Broadband Providers to Common-Carrier Regulation Would Be  Profoundly Unwise as a Policy Matter   Any reclassification of broadband Internet access service as including a distinct Title II  telecommunications service would be a calamitous reversal of policy.
EXPERT	As explained herein,  reclassification would be devastating to broadband investment and innovation, as numerous  policymakers and analysts agree and as experience with utility-style regulation confirms.
EXPERT	Such  an approach also would reduce consumer protections by divesting the Federal Trade Commission  (\u201cFTC\u201d) of authority to review commercial practices in the broadband marketplace.
EXPERT	These  harms cannot be remedied through selective forbearance action, as some have argued.
EXPERT	And   18    ironically, reclassification would trigger these harms without bringing any cognizable policy  benefits.
EXPERT	1.
EXPERT	Title II reclassification would cripple broadband investment and stifle  innovation   The dynamism, innovation, and rapid growth that characterize today\u2019s Internet would be  lost if the Commission were to reclassify any component of broadband Internet access service as  a Title II telecommunications service.
EXPERT	As noted above, broadband providers have poured more  than a trillion dollars into expanding and enhancing their networks over the years, relying on the  Commission\u2019s repeated confirmation that such providers would not be required to unbundle  those networks or incur the various other regulatory costs that would flow from the classification  of broadband Internet access service under Title II.
EXPERT	Reversing course now and subjecting current  and future broadband services and networks to common-carrier regulation would dramatically  upset the private sector incentives that have fueled the explosive growth of the Internet.
EXPERT	The  burdens and uncertainty associated with Title II regulation\u2014or even the threat of such  regulation\u2014would deter broadband providers from making the substantial additional  investments required to deploy new and upgraded broadband infrastructure.
EXPERT	This chilling effect,  in turn, would endanger efforts to meet the Commission\u2019s broadband deployment goals and  disrupt the \u201cvirtuous circle\u201d of deployment, innovation, and adoption that the Commission has  long sought to promote.
EXPERT	The Commission itself has consistently recognized the investment-inhibiting and  innovation-curtailing effects of Title II requirements in the broadband arena.
EXPERT	When the  Commission addressed the regulatory status of Internet access service in 1998 under Chairman  Kennard\u2019s leadership, it explained that regulating broadband Internet access providers as  common carriers could \u201cseriously curtail the regulatory freedom that .

EXPERT	was important to the   19    healthy and competitive development of the enhanced-services industry.\u201d45  Similarly, when the  Commission and Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) sought Supreme Court review in the Brand X  case to prevent the imposition of common-carrier regulation on broadband services, they  identified a host of potentially crippling regulatory burdens that would result from Title II  reclassification, including \u201ca new federal duty to furnish \u2018communication service upon  reasonable request therefor\u2019; to charge \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 rates; to refrain from engaging in  \u2018unjust or unreasonable discrimination\u2019; to comply with FCC requirements for filing and abiding  by written tariffs; and to interconnect with other carriers\u201d46\u2014in addition to obligations to  contribute to universal service and other funding mechanisms as well as other requirements  created for the world of voice telephony.47  The Commission and DOJ emphasized in their  petition that imposing such regulatory burdens on broadband could force providers \u201cto raise their  prices and postpone or forego plans to deploy new broadband infrastructure, particularly in rural  or other underserved areas.\u201d48  These risks remain just as serious today.
EXPERT	Numerous policymakers and industry analysts concur with the Commission\u2019s historical  assessment of the dangers of Title II reclassification\u2014observing that the threat of common- carrier regulation would damage broadband providers, discourage infrastructure investment,  stifle job growth, and harm consumers.

EXPERT	One  recently observed that, \u201c[a]s the mostly unregulated Internet piles success upon success, boosting  bandwidth and transforming each industry it touches, with no end in sight, the old, heavily  regulated, Title II network is barely an afterthought and is rapidly approaching full retirement.\u201d53   Others have appropriately pointed to the European experience with imposing public-utility-style  regulation on broadband as a cautionary tale.

EXPERT	A report released several months after the Commission\u2019s 2010  reclassification proposal analyzed these \u201ccable stock losses and ratings downgrades that occurred  in the wake of the FCC\u2019s announcement that it will seek to reclassify broadband Internet access  as a service regulated by Title II of the Communications Act,\u201d concluding that \u201c[a] causal  relationship exists between onerous FCC regulation and negative economic activity in the  immediate communications sector and the broader U.S. economy.\u201d61  Notably, these adverse  effects came when the Commission merely proposed to reclassify broadband Internet access  service under Title II.
EXPERT	Actually adopting such a reclassification likely would prove far more  harmful.
EXPERT	The dangers of Title II reclassification also are apparent from other contexts in which the  government has imposed public-utility-style regulation, as such an approach has typically led to  chronic under-investment in basic infrastructure.
EXPERT	One need only look to the nation\u2019s woefully  underfunded and increasingly vulnerable electrical grid and its crumbling transportation  infrastructure to appreciate the dangers of such a regulatory approach.
EXPERT	A recent study found that  most of America\u2019s drinking water infrastructure is nearing the end of its useful life and will need  $1 trillion in investment in the coming decades, and that America\u2019s electric grid will require a  $736 billion shot in the arm by 2020 to keep it from failing.62  The same study found that one in  three major U.S. roads is in poor or mediocre condition and that repairing and maintaining these  roads will require an estimated $170 billion in annual investment, and that one in four bridges is                                                    61   Charles M.

EXPERT	As AT&T pointed out in a recent letter to the Commission, \u201conce the Commission separates  transmission from information processing, there is no way logically to limit that rationale to one  segment of the Internet and not others.\u201d65  Rather, \u201cthe logic behind reclassification would  dictate that .

EXPERT	The Commission cannot avoid these policy harms through forbearance  proceedings   These dangers cannot be mitigated through selective application of the Commission\u2019s  forbearance authority, as the NPRM seems to suggest.72  The Commission has acknowledged in  the past that reclassification \u201cwould effectively impose a presumption in favor of Title II  regulation\u201d of broadband providers, which \u201cwould be inconsistent with the deregulatory and  procompetitive goals of the 1996 Act\u201d and would \u201cchill innovation\u201d in the process.73  Similarly,  in the petition for certiorari in Brand X filed jointly with DOJ, the Commission explained that  \u201cthe FCC\u2019s forbearance authority is not in this context an effective means of removing regulatory  uncertainty\u201d and likely would only contribute to the uncertainty presented by reclassification.74   The petition correctly recognized that \u201c[f]orbearance proceedings would be time-consuming and  hotly contested and would assuredly lead to new rounds of litigation, and there is no way to                                                    70   See 15 U.S.C.

EXPERT	And in any  event, any near-term forbearance relief the Commission might grant would provide little comfort  to ISPs, in light of the opportunities for direct or collateral attacks by future Commissions and  other parties.

EXPERT	Title II reclassification would not advance its proponents\u2019 asserted policy  objectives    The ultimate irony of the renewed calls for Title II reclassification is that, for all the  harms such an approach would cause, it would not even achieve the policy objectives that  proponents of reclassification seem to favor.
EXPERT	As noted above, many who push for  reclassification see it as a basis for adopting an outright ban on so-called \u201cpaid prioritization\u201d  arrangements between broadband ISPs and edge providers.
EXPERT	These proponents apparently believe  that such a ban could be imposed under Section 202(a) of the Act, which prohibits a  telecommunication carrier from engaging in \u201cunjust and unreasonable discrimination\u201d in  connection with its telecommunications service or providing any person \u201cundue or unreasonable  preference or advantage [or] \u2026 disadvantage,\u201d76 or under Section 201(b), which requires all  \u201ccharges, practices, classifications, and regulations\u201d for and in connection with a  telecommunications service to be \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d77  But neither of these provisions can  bear the weight that proponents of a ban on paid prioritization would have them carry.

EXPERT	Circuit, prevents  telecommunications carriers from charging \u201cunjustifiably different rates for the same service.\u201d78   Service providers thus remain free to offer customers different levels of service at different  rates\u2014as may be the case in a hypothetical paid prioritization arrangement\u2014and may even  charge different prices for similar services where there is a \u201cneutral, rational basis underlying  [the] apparently disparate charges.\u201d79  The Commission itself acknowledged this limitation in the  2009 Open Internet NPRM, when distinguishing between a proposal to adopt an \u201cunqualified  prohibition[] on discrimination\u201d and the \u201cgeneral prohibition on \u2018unjust or unreasonable  discrimination\u2019 by common carriers in section 202(a) of the Act.\u201d80  Indeed, courts and the  Commission have often found that alleged \u201cdiscrimination\u201d or \u201cpreferences\u201d accorded by service  providers in particular circumstances were \u201creasonable\u201d after a careful examination of the facts  at issue.81  Thus, far from supporting an outright ban on an entire class of prioritization  arrangements between ISPs and edge providers, Section 202(a) would at most authorize the  Commission to undertake a fact-specific, case-by-case analysis of the reasonableness of any                                                    78   Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Regulatory Utility Comm\u2019rs v.

EXPERT	29    particular prioritization arrangement\u2014authority that the Commission already appears to  possesses in the broadband arena under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act.82   Section 201(b) likewise would not support a categorical ban on paid prioritization  arrangements.
EXPERT	In applying the \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d requirement of this provision, the  Commission has focused largely on addressing discrete consumer protection issues, such as  prohibiting \u201cblocking or otherwise restricting or degrading\u201d communications to rural  consumers,83 or preventing deceptive billing practices by telecommunications carriers.84  These  issues bear no resemblance to potential \u201cpaid prioritization\u201d arrangements between edge  providers and ISPs, particularly when such arrangements do not diminish or degrade the quality  of existing broadband Internet access service.
EXPERT	In fact, such arrangements more closely resemble  the \u201climited, customer-specific service[s]\u201d offered under \u201cprivate contractual relationships\u201d that  courts and the Commission have long permitted telecommunications carriers to undertake  without \u201cvitiat[ing their] common carrier status.\u201d85  Nor is there any factual basis for concluding  that all \u201cpaid prioritization\u201d arrangements would be per se unjust and unreasonable under  Section 201(b) in a manner that could support a blanket ban, especially given that no broadband  providers have entered into such arrangements or even have plans to do so.
EXPERT	Section 201(b)  therefore would be no more effective than Section 202(a) at sustaining the prohibition on \u201cpaid  prioritization\u201d that proponents of reclassification seek.
EXPERT	The Commission may be able to justify  adopting certain presumptions of unreasonableness in connection with particular practices under                                                    82   See Verizon, 740 F.3d at 657 (contrasting the Commission\u2019s vacated non-discrimination  rule from a potentially permissible, case-by-case \u201ccommercial reasonableness\u201d standard).

EXPERT	Abandoning the Commission\u2019s Long-Held Classification of Broadband  Internet Access Service as an Information Service Would Be Counterfactual  and Unlawful   Even if, in the face of all of these policy harms, the Commission still decided to pursue  the nuclear option of Title II reclassification, it would face significant and likely insurmountable  legal hurdles in adopting such an approach.
EXPERT	At bottom, any Title II approach would require  explaining, as a factual matter, how broadband providers actually \u201coffer\u201d consumers  \u201ctelecommunications\u201d on a stand-alone basis\u2014and in doing so, contradicting the long-held  factual findings and legal conclusions that have undergirded the Commission\u2019s previous  decisions and spurred the unprecedented level of investment in the nation\u2019s broadband  infrastructure over the past two decades.
EXPERT	While it is true that the Commission can change course  to pursue a new policy direction if it can provide a sufficiently cogent rationale for doing so, the  Commission would be extremely hard-pressed to articulate such a rationale here, particularly  given that the factual details surrounding the provision of broadband Internet access service have  not materially changed since the Commission\u2019s prior determinations, and in light of the  significant reliance interests engendered in the industry by those prior determinations.
EXPERT	As the Supreme Court made clear in Brand X, \u201c[t]he entire question\u201d in classifying  broadband Internet access service \u201cturns not on the language of the Act, but on the factual  particulars of how Internet technology works and how it is provided.\u201d86  Accordingly, the  Commission has recognized that the classification of a service \u201cturns on the nature of the                                                    86   Nat\u2019l Cable & Telecomms.

EXPERT	Opponents of the  Cable Modem Order argued that the Commission \u201ccould not permissibly construe the  Communications Act to exempt cable companies providing Internet service from Title II  regulation.\u201d90  But the Court sided with the Commission, pointing specifically to a variety of  integrated, information-processing functions inherent in the provision of Internet access service  that supported the Commission\u2019s interpretation.

EXPERT	According to the Supreme Court, in certain circumstances where the  Commission seeks to depart from a prior policy, it must \u201cprovide a more detailed justification  than what would suffice for a new policy created on a blank slate\u201d\u2014specifically, when \u201cits new  policy rests upon factual findings that contradict those which underlay its prior policy,\u201d or \u201cwhen  its prior policy has engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.\u201d97   Indeed, the Supreme Court has made clear that \u201c[i]t would be arbitrary or capricious to ignore  such matters.\u201d98  And, critically, both of these circumstances are present here.
EXPERT	Any decision to  classify broadband Internet access service under Title II necessarily would rest on factual  findings that would conflict with findings on which the Commission has repeatedly relied in  adopting its \u201cinformation service\u201d classification numerous times in the past.
EXPERT	Moreover, there is  no question that the Commission\u2019s prior decisions that avoided the burdens of Title II have  engendered significant reliance interests.
EXPERT	As detailed in Section I above, broadband providers  have invested more than $1.2 trillion in broadband infrastructure based on the reasonable  understanding that the Commission would continue to treat broadband as a lightly regulated  \u201cinformation service\u201d under Title I\u2014an outcome that the Commission expressly anticipated and                                                                                                                                                                is \u2018telecommunications,\u2019 and that the offering of this telecommunications transmission  component as part of a functionally integrated, finished BPL-enabled Internet access  service offering is not a \u2018telecommunications service\u2019\u201d).

EXPERT	It is doubtful that the Commission could articulate a justification that could meet this high  hurdle, as the \u201cfactual particulars\u201d that informed the Commission\u2019s prior decisions\u2014and that  must underlie any future classification of broadband Internet access services100\u2014have not  changed in any material way.

EXPERT	The provision of broadband Internet access  service also includes other capabilities that were not a focus of the Commission\u2019s earlier orders  but go well beyond mere transmission, including Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol                                                    99   See, e.g., Cable Modem Order PP 4, 5 (explaining that \u201cbroadband services should exist  in a minimal regulatory environment that promotes investment\u201d and limits \u201cunnecessary  and unduly burdensome regulatory costs\u201d); Wireline Broadband Order P 3 (explaining  that a \u201clighter regulatory touch \u2026 will promote the availability of competitive broadband  Internet access services to consumers, via multiple platforms, while ensuring adequate  incentives are in place to encourage the deployment and innovation of broadband  platforms\u201d); BPL Order P 2 (\u201c[A] minimal regulatory environment for BPL-enabled  Internet access service \u2026 promotes our goal of ubiquitous availability of broadband to all  Americans.\u201d); Wireless Broadband Order P 27 (\u201cThrough this classification, we provide  the regulatory certainty needed to help spur growth and deployment of these services.\u201d).

EXPERT	In recent years, broadband providers have expanded the information- processing functionality of their services to include parental controls,104 and online connection  management.105    The mere fact that broadband customers sometimes rely on third parties to varying  degrees for some of these functions does not somehow transform broadband Internet access  service into a telecommunications service, as some have argued.106  As an initial matter, it is  nothing new that end users can employ features from independent entities rather than utilize  these functions as offered by their broadband provider.

EXPERT	Absent any showing that broadband ISPs are in fact operating as \u201ctelecommunications  carriers\u201d by offering \u201ctelecommunications\u201d to the public indiscriminately, the Commission could  not impose common-carrier status on ISPs unless it were to conclude that ISPs should have a                                                    107   See Paul Wood, Symantec, \u201cReflections on the Fifteen Year Anniversary of Hotmail,\u201d  Jul.

EXPERT	Although some advocates  appear to believe (mistakenly) that such an about-face is necessary to support their preferred  policy outcome, the Commission is prohibited from \u201cimpos[ing] common carrier status upon any  given entity on the basis of the desired policy goal the Commission seeks to advance.\u201d114  Rather,  the D.C.

EXPERT	For all these reasons, if the Commission were to pursue a Title II reclassification theory,  it would face the considerable risk of being reversed yet again in its efforts to impose open  Internet requirements.
EXPERT	An order based on Title II would be far more likely to attract a legal  challenge than an order based on Section 706, given the sheer magnitude of the harms that such  reclassification would present.
EXPERT	Such an order also would be far less likely to survive such a  challenge.
EXPERT	As noted above, the Commission would need to provide \u201ca more detailed  explanation\u201d in adopting a new \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d classification where, as here, the  prior classification was based on contrary factual findings and engendered significant reliance  interests.117  The Commission thus may not be accorded the same degree of deference in  adopting a new \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d classification as it enjoyed when defending its  \u201cinformation service\u201d classification in Brand X, and may well find such a determination  intensely scrutinized and ultimately vacated by a reviewing court.

The Commission Should Reject Proposals To Reclassify the Return-Path  Element of Broadband Internet Access Service Under Title II   The NPRM also seeks comment on proposals that aim to impose Title II obligations on  broadband providers by attempting to sidestep the Commission\u2019s historical classification of  broadband Internet access as an information service.118  The NPRM cites two largely overlapping  proposals from Mozilla and Professors Narechania and Wu, both of which urge the Commission                                                    117   See supra at 33 (quoting Fox, 556 U.S. at 515); cf.

EXPERT	According to  their theory, the transmission of edge-provider traffic in response to end user requests  purportedly falls \u201coutside the category of services previously designated by the Commission\u201d121  and thus provides a blank slate on which the Commission supposedly can adopt a Title II  classification and impose common-carrier restrictions without the need to overturn Commission  precedent.122     Such proposals should be rejected for several reasons.
EXPERT	As an initial matter, the premise  that the classification of \u201cresponse\u201d transmissions is an open question is simply wrong.
EXPERT	The  Commission has consistently made clear that, when classifying broadband Internet access service  as an information service, it understood the service to include not only the end user\u2019s request for  online content, but also the delivery of such content to end users in response to such requests.
EXPERT	In  the 1998 Report to Congress, when applying the \u201cinformation service\u201d label to \u201cInternet-based  offerings\u201d and other \u201cmixed or hybrid services,\u201d the Commission described such services as  those \u201cin which a provider offers a capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming,  processing, retrieving, utilizing or making available information via telecommunications, and as                                                    119   See Mozilla, Petition to Recognize Remote Delivery Services in Terminating Access  Networks and Classify Such Services as Telecommunications Services Under Title II of  the Communications Act, GN Docket Nos.

EXPERT	40    an inseparable part of that service transmits information supplied or requested by the user.\u201d123   Similarly, in the Cable Modem Order, the Commission described the cable modem service being  classified as including \u201cthe ability to retrieve information from the Internet, including access to  the World Wide Web.\u201d124  The Commission again declined to distinguish between \u201crequest\u201d and  \u201cdelivery\u201d functions in broadband Internet access service in the Wireline Broadband Order,  finding that \u201cwireline broadband Internet access service\u201d is \u201ca single, integrated service\u201d that  \u201cprovides the user with the ability to send and receive information at very high speed, and to  access the applications and services available through the Internet.\u201d125  Therefore, far from  sidestepping the Commission\u2019s past orders, the theory of reclassification advanced by Mozilla  and Professors Narechania and Wu would run headlong into this precedent.
EXPERT	Some proponents of this approach also assert\u2014based on a gross misreading of Verizon  decision\u2014that the D.C.
EXPERT	Circuit found that ISPs are already providing a severable  telecommunications service to edge providers.126  But such an assertion overlooks the fact that  the Verizon court\u2019s decision to vacate the no-blocking and non-discrimination rules was  premised on the notion that ISPs are not providing a telecommunications service and cannot be  forced by the Commission to do so.

EXPERT	41    Commission is precluded from performing \u201cradical surgery\u201d by compelling broadband providers  to offer some distinct \u201cremote delivery service\u201d as a Title II telecommunications service.127   It is no answer for Mozilla and others to retort that broadband Internet access service  necessarily involves \u201ctelecommunications\u201d of some kind.128  The very definition of \u201cinformation  service\u201d is \u201cthe offering of a capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming,  processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information via telecommunications.\u201d129   The Commission has recognized that \u201c[a]ll information services require the use of  telecommunications to connect customers to the computers or other processors that are capable  of generating, storing, or manipulating information.\u201d130  Indeed, every time the Commission has  classified broadband Internet access service as an information service, it has done so recognizing  that the various integrated functions involved are provided \u201cvia telecommunications.\u201d131  Thus,  even if it were possible (and consistent with precedent) to separate out a return-path service  distinct from the integrated information service offered by broadband ISPs, the fact that such a  service involves \u201ctelecommunications\u201d would not, on its own, transform the service into a  common-carrier \u201ctelecommunications service.\u201d  Such a standalone service could be a private  carrier service as well.
EXPERT	Indeed, as the Commission recognized in the Cable Modem Order, \u201c[t]o  the extent that [a broadband provider] is making an offering of pure telecommunications to ISPs,  it is dealing with each ISP on an individualized basis and is not offering any transmission service                                                    127   See supra at 36-37.

EXPERT	The nature of packet- switched communications, the mechanism on which Internet Protocol communications are based,  would render such distinctions utterly unworkable.
EXPERT	Nearly every online operation\u2014from  accessing a website to downloading a file to viewing a video to engaging in online gaming\u2014 entails numerous and often nearly simultaneous signals between the website and the end user.
EXPERT	These signals are further subdivided into packets\u2014information that is broken up into small  pieces for transmission across the network.
EXPERT	The process of sorting out the \u201ccall\u201d and \u201cresponse\u201d  transmissions in these circumstances for the purpose of ensuring compliance with differing  regulatory regimes would be entirely unmanageable, as it presumably would require an ISP to  physically inspect the contents of each and every packet to evaluate whether it contains only the  information from the so-called \u201cremote service.\u201d  Even Mozilla implicitly recognizes the  intractability of this approach, conceding that a transmission service to edge providers is at most  \u201clogically and legally distinguishable,\u201d because the remaining transmission functions are not  \u201cphysically separable.\u201d133  But here, too, Mozilla runs up against the realities of how the Internet  functions.
EXPERT	Broadband providers simply do not have direct relationships with the edge providers  whose content their subscribers are seeking; in other words, there is no \u201cservice\u201d being offered to  edge providers that is distinguishable in any way from the \u201cservice\u201d being offered to end users.
EXPERT	The artificiality of the approach advanced by Mozilla and Professors Wu and Narechania is only  underscored by the way broadband Internet access service is marketed to consumers, who choose                                                    132   Cable Modem Order P 55.

EXPERT	Finally, as with the broader reclassification proposals, the approach suggested by Mozilla  and Professors Wu and Narechania would not even accomplish the policy objectives that they  and other proponents of reclassification seem to desire.
EXPERT	These parties appear to believe that  imposing Title II requirements on broadband ISPs\u2019 transmissions of edge-provider content to end  users would preclude ISPs from seeking payment in connection with those transmissions.
EXPERT	But  even setting aside the fact the ISPs have not entered into and have no plans to explore paid  arrangements with edge providers, the Commission could not combine any Title II classification  of so-called \u201cremote delivery services\u201d with a ban on payments between edge providers and  ISPs, as a common carrier is, by definition, one who provides service \u201cfor a fee.\u201d134  In short,  these proposals are riddled with fundamental factual and legal misconceptions and should be  rejected.

Adopting a \u201cSpringing\u201d or \u201cBackstop\u201d Title II Theory Would Be Arbitrary  and Capricious   As the NPRM notes, some have argued that if the Commission proceeds to adopt open  Internet rules under Section 706, it should nevertheless \u201cuse Title II as a \u2018backstop authority.\u2019\u201d135   One proposal cited in the NPRM would have the Commission \u201cissu[e] one order under [S]ection  706 and a contingent order under Title II\u201d that would automatically spring into being if a court                                                    134   47 U.S.C.

EXPERT	As  noted above, the mere threat of Title II reclassification can bring about disastrous policy harms,  including greatly diminished broadband investment, deployment, and innovation.
EXPERT	Moreover, in  adopting Title II as a \u201cbackstop,\u201d the Commission still would need to overcome the significant  legal hurdles that such a classification necessarily would entail.
EXPERT	Indeed, it is impossible to see  how the Commission could write an order that, on the one hand, concludes that the \u201cfactual  particulars\u201d of broadband Internet access service support continued classification as an  information service regulated under Section 706, but on the other hand states that, if any new  rules are invalidated, the \u201cfactual particulars\u201d support the conclusion that broadband is best  classified as a telecommunications service.
EXPERT	This is particularly true in light of the Commission\u2019s  repeated holding that the categories of \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d and \u201cinformation service\u201d  are \u201cmutually exclusive.\u201d138   At bottom, the notion that Title II could spring into effect for purely policy reasons would  all but assure that such a classification would be found to be arbitrary and capricious, as it would                                                    136   Letter from Rep.

EXPERT	1.
EXPERT	There is no basis for the Commission\u2019s tentative conclusion that enhanced  transparency rules are needed   Although the NPRM proposes to adopt a variety of \u201cenhancements\u201d to the transparency  regime established in 2010, there is no factual basis for taking such a step.
EXPERT	The NPRM  acknowledges that there have been no formal complaints regarding inadequate disclosure in the  three years that the rules have been in effect.153  While the NPRM suggests that there have been  \u201chundreds\u201d of informal complaints\u2014a relatively low number given the 163 million broadband  Internet access connections reported by the Commission154\u2014the mere existence of these filings,  absent any indication that they resulted in actual findings of wrongdoing, plainly does not justify  additional transparency rules.155  Indeed, in most cases, it is not clear whether a particular  complaint pertains to an ISP\u2019s disclosures or its provision of service\u2014a fact the NPRM  acknowledges.156  The only rational conclusion the Commission could draw from such data is  that, by and large, ISPs are disclosing the information consumers need to make intelligent  decisions about which providers and tiers of service to choose.
EXPERT	The NPRM also raises a concern about ISPs\u2019 supposed failure to deliver advertised  speeds.
EXPERT	But in doing so it relies on a single informal complaint,157 and ignores the rigorous                                                    152   2010 Open Internet Order P 56.

EXPERT	49    testing the agency has been conducting for three years under the Measuring Broadband America  project.
EXPERT	The most recent report issued by the Commission, based on over 8 billion observations  conducted using third-party routers and test servers, demonstrates conclusively that cable  operators and other broadband providers are delivering the services they advertise and that no  additional disclosure obligations are necessary.158   The NPRM likewise points to scattered informal complaints about applications or  services that do not function as anticipated by the customer as a purported basis for increased  disclosure obligations.159  But this discussion ignores the Commission\u2019s consistent recognition  that there are a variety of factors outside an ISP\u2019s control that affect performance, including the  equipment used in the home and various decisions made by content providers.160  The  unsurprising fact that some consumers occasionally experience a problem with a particular  application or service does not give the Commission sufficient information to determine whether  responsibility for such problems rests with the content provider, the ISP, some intermediate  network, or the customer\u2019s home network.
EXPERT	Absent such information, informal complaints like  the ones cited in the NPRM provide no basis for imposing additional disclosure obligations on  ISPs.

EXPERT	There is no need to enhance the disclosures ISPs make to retail customers   The Commission should not adopt any of its proposals to enhance the disclosures that  ISPs must make to retail customers.
EXPERT	As explained below, each of these proposals would impose  significant new burdens without providing customers with any meaningful new information.
EXPERT	For example, the Commission should reject its proposal to \u201crequire disclosures that  permit end-users to identify application-specific usage or to distinguish which user or device  contributed to which part of total data usage.\u201d161  Such a requirement likely would necessitate  significant use of deep packet inspection in an attempt to determine the user or device  responsible for originating or receiving particular Internet traffic.
EXPERT	Even if it were feasible to  implement the necessary network changes, tracking usage at a user- or device-specific level  would require significant ISP resources as well as significant customer coordination.
EXPERT	The Commission also should reject the proposal by Cogent that ISPs be required to report  performance at a local level, rather than the national level currently measured by the Measuring  Broadband America project.162  This proposal is utterly impractical and would be extremely  burdensome for ISPs.
EXPERT	The expense of recruiting a sufficient number of volunteers to obtain a  statistically valid sample in each local community and then distributing the requisite equipment  to each of those volunteers would be overwhelming.
EXPERT	Along the same lines, Cogent\u2019s proposal that ISPs report the performance received by the  250 most popular edge providers could not be implemented in any meaningful or accurate  manner.163  As with the Commission\u2019s proposal to require reporting of application-specific usage                                                    161   NPRM P 73.

EXPERT	51    to consumers, such a requirement would impose tremendous burdens on ISPs and could raise  significant concerns because it likely would require the substantial use of deep packet inspection  to track the delivery of all Internet traffic to determine which edge providers are the 250 most  popular.
EXPERT	Moreover, as with other elements of the enhanced transparency rules proposed in the  item, such an approach erroneously assumes that all responsibility for the performance  experienced by consumers rests with ISPs and ignores the significant role that edge providers  may play in that performance.
EXPERT	Finally, the Commission should not mandate the use of standardized formats for  disclosures by ISPs.164  NCTA previously has identified a number of concerns that would arise in  connection with any mandatory labeling program for broadband services.165  The Open Internet  Advisory Committee report that the Commission cites as the basis for this proposal also  recognized that there are numerous complexities associated with standardized labels and  potential concerns about such labels misleading consumers.166  Consequently, that report did not  suggest mandatory labels, but instead proposed that the Commission \u201cwork with the industry to  develop a voluntary labeling program.\u201d167  If the Commission decides to pursue standardized  disclosures, NCTA would welcome the opportunity to participate in the development of a  voluntary program, just as we did in connection with the Measuring Broadband America  program.

EXPERT	52    3.
EXPERT	The Commission should not require ISPs to provide tailored disclosures  for edge providers  The Commission also should reconsider and ultimately reject its tentative conclusion that  ISPs should be required to make disclosures that are specifically geared to the business needs of  edge providers.168  There is no sound reason to impose such a one-sided requirement and no  practical manner by which ISPs could cater to the needs of millions of different edge providers.
EXPERT	As an initial matter, the NPRM does not provide any basis to conclude that the disclosures  currently made by ISPs are somehow inadequate to meet the needs of edge providers.
EXPERT	Edge  providers of all sizes have thrived in the three years since the transparency rules took effect, and  the NPRM does not cite a single example of an edge provider whose business was affected, let  alone harmed, in any way by insufficient disclosure by ISPs.
EXPERT	As compared to the negligible benefits that might arise from requiring ISPs to make  specific disclosures to edge providers, the burdens would be substantial.
EXPERT	As NCTA and others  explained when the transparency rules were adopted in 2010, it is completely impractical to  require ISPs to make disclosures that are specifically tailored to the business needs of edge  providers.169  ISPs have no way to anticipate the needs of millions of content providers nor  should the Commission hold ISPs responsible for the successful operation of businesses with  whom they have no contractual relationship.
EXPERT	The one-sided nature of the proposed obligation  compounds these problems.
EXPERT	The notion that ISPs should have a disclosure obligation running to  every edge provider on the Internet, while those edge providers have no obligation to provide                                                    168   See NPRM P 68.

EXPERT	53    any information to ISPs, is patently unfair.
EXPERT	This lopsided approach would be particularly  harmful to small ISPs, which would be at a huge disadvantage in any dealings with large content  providers like Google, Amazon, and Netflix, all of which operate networks that are far more  extensive than those operated by many small ISPs.
EXPERT	4.
EXPERT	The Commission\u2019s proposal to require ISPs, and only ISPs, to report on  network congestion is impractical and unwarranted   The Commission likewise should reject the proposal to require ISPs to \u201cdisclose  meaningful information regarding the source, location, timing, speed, packet loss, and duration  of network congestion.\u201d170  As an initial matter, congestion at a particular point in the network is  not necessarily evidence that the quality of service to consumers has been degraded, because ISP  networks are built with redundant paths that enable Internet traffic to be routed around points of  congestion.
EXPERT	Furthermore, as the NPRM acknowledges, network congestion can occur at any  point in the Internet, not just the last-mile portion controlled by ISPs.171  And as demonstrated by  a number of studies, edge providers have significant control over how they deliver their traffic to  ISPs.172  For example, some large content providers like Netflix may choose to route traffic over  congested links from transit providers rather than spending more money to route traffic over                                                    170   NPRM P 83; see also 2014 Measuring Broadband America Report at 5-6.

EXPERT	For example, the Commission has recognized that Wi-Fi performance in the home and  various other types of equipment used to access online content can have a substantial effect on  the performance experienced by an end user.174   Even if there were a basis for imposing a congestion-reporting obligation only on ISPs,  and there is not, such a requirement would be utterly impractical and tremendously burdensome.
EXPERT	The Commission has not defined the term \u201ccongestion\u201d or offered any explanation as to how it  would establish a reporting threshold that would be appropriate for all different types of ISPs.
EXPERT	Based on NCTA\u2019s experience helping the Commission develop the Measuring Broadband  America testing regime, attempting to devise a new metric for congestion that would be  meaningful and accurate across different technologies would be extremely challenging.
EXPERT	Moreover, network congestion often is ephemeral and occurs in a highly specific manner with  respect to time and location,175 and thus does not lend itself to any sort of meaningful reporting  to the Commission or to the public.
EXPERT	The bottom line is that requiring ISPs to report network congestion but ignoring all these  other relevant factors would not provide the information necessary to perform a proper analysis                                                    173   Mediacom Letter at 6-8.

EXPERT	5.
EXPERT	The Commission\u2019s proposals to expand its oversight and enforcement of  transparency mandates are unjustified   Lastly, while the NPRM proposes a variety of oversight and enforcement mechanisms to  ensure that ISPs are complying with the Commission\u2019s transparency rules,176 none of these new  mechanisms is necessary, and they would serve only to increase the burdens imposed on ISPs.
EXPERT	For example, the proposal to permit anonymous reporting of transparency concerns based on  supposed retaliation concerns is misplaced.
EXPERT	Just as the NPRM does not identify a single instance  of any formal complaint alleging a transparency violation, there are no known examples of  retaliation by ISPs.
EXPERT	Moreover, ISPs have no practical ability to retaliate against edge providers  and no reason to retaliate against consumers.177  There simply is no legitimate basis for imposing  rules on ISPs due to this unsupported fear of retaliation.178                                                    176   NPRM PP 87-88.
EXPERT	177   Conversely, many large edge providers, such as Amazon and YouTube, recently have  demonstrated the ability and willingness to harm other companies and their customers by  withholding or delaying the delivery of content.

EXPERT	178   See also infra Section III.D (explaining that retaliation concerns in connection with other  kinds of complaints are similarly unsupported).
EXPERT	56     Similarly, the proposal to require ISPs to report on instances of blocking or throttling is  unnecessary and impractical.
EXPERT	While some ISPs may manage traffic in some circumstances as  part of their efforts to address network congestion, such policies already are subject to disclosure  under the existing transparency rules.
EXPERT	Expanding the existing requirements by requiring  disclosure of individual applications of providers\u2019 policies would be extremely burdensome and  would not provide meaningful information to consumers.
EXPERT	B.
EXPERT	Any New No-Blocking Rules Must Comport with the Limitations Identified  by the Verizon Court   The NPRM also proposes to reinstate\u2014with some modifications\u2014the no-blocking rule  vacated by the Verizon court.
EXPERT	The proposed text of the new no-blocking rule for fixed broadband  providers largely tracks the language of the old rule, and would prevent \u201c[a] person engaged in  the provision of fixed broadband Internet access service\u201d from \u201cblock[ing] lawful content,  applications, services, or non-harmful devices, subject to reasonable network management.\u201d179   Unlike the prior rule, however, the proposed new rule would be accompanied by a clarification  that the standard \u201cwould allow individualized bargaining above a minimum level of access to a  broadband provider\u2019s subscribers\u2014the revised rationale the court suggested would be  permissible rather than per se common carriage.\u201d180                                                      179   NPRM P 94.
EXPERT	Notably, the NPRM also proposes adopting a less restrictive no-blocking  rule for mobile wireless providers, as the Commission did in the 2010 Open Internet  Order.
EXPERT	Id.
EXPERT	As discussed in Section IV.A below, however, the Commission should seek  to harmonize rather than maintain unwarranted distinctions in any rules it adopts for fixed  and mobile broadband providers, particularly now that mobile broadband services are  maturing into increasingly viable alternatives to fixed broadband services.

EXPERT	P 95.
EXPERT	57     As a general matter, and as NCTA has explained previously, a reinstated no-blocking rule  is likely unnecessary.181  NCTA and its members and other leading broadband providers have  consistently pledged that they will not block subscribers\u2019 access to lawful Internet content and  services, both before the Commission adopted the no-blocking rules in the Open Internet Order  and after those rules were vacated by the Verizon court.182  Indeed, as noted above in Section I,  broadband ISPs benefit from an open Internet as much as other participants in the Internet  ecosystem, and thus have a powerful incentive to ensure that lawful Internet content remains  available to all.
EXPERT	Nevertheless, if the Commission chooses to reinstate a no-blocking requirement, it should  refrain from establishing rigid, quantitative or qualitative measures for the \u201cminimum level of  access\u201d that would be deemed \u201ceffectively usable\u201d under the rule.183  The Commission has  acknowledged that the Internet has always operated under a flexible \u201cbest effort\u201d standard for the                                                    181   See NCTA PN Comments at 6-12.

EXPERT	Such restraint would appropriately recognize that \u201cbest effort\u201d delivery has  always been and will continue to be sufficient to ensure end users\u2019 access to the entire Internet,  as competition and consumer demand continue to drive broadband providers to invest in and  improve the quality and speed of their networks.
EXPERT	A \u201cbest effort\u201d standard also would take into  account the possibility, inherent in all networks, that performance may vary according to traffic  load or other issues beyond the network provider\u2019s control.
EXPERT	Ultimately, the competitive  marketplace, and not the Commission, is in the best position to establish appropriate levels of  service.
EXPERT	For similar reasons, the Commission should decline to establish \u201cspecific technical  parameters, such as a minimum speed,\u201d that an ISP would need to maintain in order to avoid  being deemed to have \u201cblocked\u201d online content under the rule.188  Such a mandate is completely                                                    184   Id.

EXPERT	Indeed, in light of the steady, market-driven advances in  broadband performance over the years, it is evident that any minimum speed imposed by the  Commission would quickly become obsolete.
EXPERT	Establishing such rigid technical parameters also  would entirely ignore the inevitable variations in performance that can affect broadband  networks, and could unfairly expose broadband providers to liability for network performance  issues that are outside of their control.
EXPERT	In addition, a rule that mandates a specific level of service to edge providers, such as a  minimum speed or other quantitative performance standard, would present a serious risk of being  deemed a common-carrier requirement.
EXPERT	In vacating the Commission\u2019s earlier no-blocking rule,  the Verizon court explained that a rule that inflexibly \u201crequir[es] that all edge providers receive  [a] minimum level of access for free\u201d would appear to \u201cimpose per se common carrier  obligations with respect to that minimum level of service.\u201d189  On the other hand, the Verizon  court also noted that minimum service standards may not constitute common carriage if \u201cthe  relevant \u2018carriage\u2019 broadband providers furnish .

EXPERT	191   Indeed, a Commission-imposed requirement to provide a baseline minimum speed to all  edge providers, even when paired with an ability to negotiate faster speeds with particular   60    considering pursuing reclassification of the telecommunications component of broadband  Internet access under Title II, it was determined to avoid imposing service-quality regulation on  the ground that such prescriptive mandates should not apply in the dynamic Internet  ecosystem.192   The concept of imposing a standard based on the expectations of a \u201creasonable person\u201d is  similarly flawed.193  Such a standard would be fraught with ambiguity, particularly given the  amorphous and constantly changing needs of a \u201creasonable\u201d broadband customer, and would  provide virtually no certainty to ISPs in their efforts to comply with any reinstated no-blocking  rule.
EXPERT	Judge Silberman acknowledged the difficulties inherent in such an approach in his  dissenting opinion in the Verizon case, noting that \u201c[i]f a faster speed were to become standard,  [consumers] would likely consider a slower speed to be effectively unusable.\u201d194  Such a  standard, inevitably dependent on subtle shifts in consumer expectations, would be entirely  unadministrable and thus should be rejected.
EXPERT	Instead, if the Commission adopts a no-blocking  rule, it should focus on preventing actual blocking of content rather than on micromanaging                                                                                                                                                                parties, would be akin to a requirement to serve all comers, at a minimum, \u201c\u2018on the same  or standardized terms\u2019\u201d\u2014a hallmark of common carriage.

EXPERT	The predicate for any  regulation\u2014and especially an effort to prohibit an entire category of commercial arrangements\u2014 should be concrete evidence of likely harm, rather than rank speculation.
EXPERT	As the DOJ and FTC  recognized, categorical bans run a serious risk of deterring beneficial arrangements that could  benefit consumers, and those risks are even greater where the nature of the arrangements in  question is so poorly understood.
EXPERT	Indeed, there are several potential examples of socially beneficial prioritization of  Internet traffic that could emerge if experimentation were permitted.
EXPERT	Few would quibble with  prioritizing traffic associated with remote heart surgery or other telemedicine applications, or  emergency 911-like communications placed using an Internet connection, over email traffic or  other applications for which high speed and low latency are not critical.202  Chairman Wheeler  provided another model for beneficial prioritization in his remarks after the NPRM was released,  noting that his Government Emergency Telecommunications Service card allows him to \u201cgo to  any phone in America and type in this number, and get priority access that you can use in a case                                                    201   See, e.g., AT&T Blog, Net Neutrality and Modern Memory, Jun.

EXPERT	The NPRM offers no explanation as to why any purported benefits of such a seemingly  limitless standard would outweigh the serious harms that overbroad regulation would inflict on  the broadband marketplace,211 or how subjecting all ISP \u201cpractices\u201d to Commission oversight  would be consistent with and advance the goals of Section 706.
EXPERT	Indeed, such an approach would  go well beyond the scope of Section 706 as interpreted by the Verizon court, and also likely  would exceed any authority the Commission might attempt to assert under Title II.212   Accordingly, if the Commission decides to adopt a \u201ccommercial reasonableness\u201d standard at all,  it should make clear that the standard governs only actual or proposed commercial relationships                                                    209   NPRM P 122 (suggesting that any \u201ccommercial reasonableness\u201d rule adopted in this  proceeding would be \u201c[s]imilar to the Commission\u2019s approach in the data roaming  context\u201d).

EXPERT	67    preclude parties from defending themselves adequately against complaints.
EXPERT	As the NPRM notes,  the 2010 Open Internet Order provided that enforcement of the rules could occur via self- initiated investigations, informal complaints, and formal complaints.215  Importantly, however,  the Commission made clear that parties should avail themselves of the complaint process only as  a last resort and \u201cencourage[d] parties to endeavor to resolve disputes through direct  negotiation,\u201d with the expectation that \u201cmany of the disputes that will arise regarding alleged  open Internet violations\u2014particularly those centered on engineering-focused questions\u2014will be  resolvable by the parties without Commission involvement.\u201d216  This approach appropriately  harnesses industry experience and practice to resolve disputes and thus should be maintained by  the Commission.
EXPERT	The Commission also should continue to explore other ways of streamlining its  enforcement procedures in a manner that provides \u201clegal certainty\u201d to regulated entities.217  The  NPRM appropriately recognizes that, in addition to its power to issue declaratory rulings, the  Commission may employ less formal methods of providing clarity on the Commission\u2019s view of  the law\u2014including business review letters, non-binding staff opinions, or enforcement  advisories.218  Such mechanisms may well prove useful to regulated entities as they endeavor to  comply with any new rules (so long as these methods do not give rise to conflicting guidance).
EXPERT	This same interest in \u201clegal certainty\u201d also militates in favor of the Commission\u2019s proposal to  work with technical advisory groups, such as the Open Internet Advisory Committee, the                                                    215   NPRM P 161.

EXPERT	In particular, regulated parties should  not be required to respond to or face penalties pursuant to complaints that leave out critical  information about the relevant facts and the identity of the complainant.
EXPERT	Allowing anonymous or  insufficiently detailed complaints not only would be patently unfair to parties accused of  violating the rules, but also would impede the Commission\u2019s ability to make well-informed  factual findings in adjudicating these claims.
EXPERT	Nor is there any basis for allowing anonymous  complaints based on concerns that ISPs will engage in \u201cretaliation.\u201d220  There is no evidence that  any informal complaints filed under the 2010 Open Internet Order led to retaliation of any sort.

EXPERT	L. 5 (2004)  (articulating four \u201cInternet freedoms\u201d\u2014  70    Order, the Commission recognized that \u201c[t]here is one Internet, which should remain open for  consumers and innovators alike, although it may be accessed through different technologies and  services.\u201d223  As the Commission rightly observed, \u201c[c]onsumer choice, freedom of expression,  end-user control, competition, and the freedom to innovate without permission are as important  when end users are accessing the Internet via mobile broadband as via fixed.\u201d224   Nevertheless, the 2010 Open Internet Order adopted two different sets of rules governing  access to the Internet, imposing more onerous restrictions on fixed providers than on mobile  providers.225  And the NPRM suggests that the Commission should maintain this bifurcated  approach,226 even as it acknowledges that the few incidents since 2010 that have raised potential  Internet openness concerns have been concentrated in the mobile wireless sector.227  But the  NPRM provides no justification for such disparate treatment, and there is none in today\u2019s  marketplace.
EXPERT	While technological differences in some circumstances might be relevant in  applying the open Internet rules\u2014for example, in determining whether a particular network  management practice is reasonable\u2014such differences should not have any bearing on whether a  given obligation applies in the first place.
EXPERT	Rather, if the Commission determines that it is  necessary to protect consumers from particular types of conduct, then it should not make any  difference whether the entity responsible for that conduct operates a fixed or mobile platform.

EXPERT	71     The 2010 Open Internet Order offered several purported justifications for subjecting  fixed and mobile broadband to different sets of rules.
EXPERT	But even assuming differential treatment  made sense in 2010, it cannot be justified today.
EXPERT	First, the 2010 order suggested that different rules might be justified by the fact that  mobile broadband was \u201can earlier-stage platform than fixed broadband\u201d and, at that time, \u201cmost  consumers used their mobile phone primarily to make phone calls and send text messages.\u201d228   But as the current NPRM recognizes, we are well past those days now.
EXPERT	As the NPRM recognizes, \u201c[a]nnual investment in U.S. wireless networks grew more  than 40 percent between 2009 and 2012, from $21 billion to $30 billion, and exceeds investment  by the major oil and gas or auto companies.\u201d229  Moreover, the market for mobile content has  exploded.
EXPERT	The NPRM notes that \u201c[a] total of $8.33 billion has been raised since 2007 on mobile  media ventures, a majority of the funds ($4.7 billion) to companies that provide software  services, including mobile Web development, carrier-backend software, app development, and  cloud-based services in the United States.\u201d230   Investment in mobile applications, in particular, has skyrocketed in recent years, with  \u201cover $1 billion in venture capital funding \u2026 invested in mobile media startups\u201d in 2013  alone.231  And this investment has paid huge dividends for mobile broadband providers and app  developers; as of March 2013, \u201cApple and Google each offered about 700,000 apps\u201d in their  respective app stores, and \u201capplication sales were approaching $25 billion.\u201d232                                                      228   2010 Open Internet Order P 94.

EXPERT	As the  Supreme Court recently noted, mobile apps now \u201coffer a range of tools for managing detailed  information about all aspects of a person\u2019s life.\u201d233  According to a recent report by Mary  Meeker of Kleiner Perkins, \u201cmobile data consumption is up 81 percent as the world turns more  to tablets and smartphones, especially to watch video,\u201d and \u201cmobile now accounts for 25 percent  of web usage, up from 14 percent a year ago.\u201d234  Fixed broadband might have gotten a head start  in supplying broadband Internet access to the nation, but mobile broadband is catching up fast.
EXPERT	The 2010 Open Internet Order also sought to justify differential treatment of mobile  broadband by noting that its \u201cspeeds, capacity, and penetration\u201d were lower than fixed  broadband, and that mobile networks faced \u201coperational constraints that fixed broadband  networks do not typically encounter.\u201d235  As an initial matter, with regard to capacity and  operational constraints, the 2010 Open Internet Order overlooked the fact that many of the same  challenges have long affected wireline broadband networks.236  And distinguishing between  fixed and mobile broadband service based on network constraints today would be illogical, given  that some of the very same networks support both fixed and mobile services.237                                                    233   Riley v.

EXPERT	When the Commission adopted the 2010 Open Internet Order, there was  effectively no 4G LTE wireless service available in the United States, but since then, mobile  operators have upgraded their networks to 4G LTE technology, which can provide for peak  download rates of 300 Mbps and uplink speeds of 75 Mbps.
EXPERT	Some providers now offer  broadband speeds in excess of 50 Mbps,238 with others promising to leapfrog to 200 Mbps in the  near future.239  Such advances now put wireless on par with the speeds and capabilities of many  fixed wireline broadband Internet access services.
EXPERT	Even data-intensive services like high- definition video, which requires bandwidth of 5-6 Mbps, can be as easily delivered over a mobile  broadband connection as over some fixed connections.240  Moreover, the four national wireless  providers collectively have deployed 4G LTE networks that blanket the country.

EXPERT	240   Again, to the extent that any relevant technical differences remain between fixed and  mobile services, the Commission can take those differences into account in assessing the  commercial reasonableness of the arrangements at issue.
EXPERT	Such differences would not  warrant separate open Internet rules.
EXPERT	74    notes, LTE subscriptions grew by a factor of nearly 500 during this period.241  And analysts  project that there will be 224 million 4G subscriptions in the United States by 2018.242   Finally, the 2010 Open Internet Order relied on the fact that \u201cmost consumers have more  choices for mobile broadband than for fixed.\u201d243  But that distinction too is of rapidly  diminishing significance, and its relevance is questionable in any event, given the Commission\u2019s  determination that the open Internet rules do not hinge on a market power theory.244  As mobile  broadband has continued to improve, mobile providers have begun advertising their services as a  substitute for fixed broadband services.245  And an ever-growing number of consumers view  them as such.246  Indeed, the Commission recently found that more than a third of all Americans  now live in wireless-only households.247     The distinction between fixed and mobile broadband from the 2010 Open Internet Order  is therefore left without any sound foundation.
EXPERT	And it is made even shakier by the proliferation                                                    241   See NPRM P 48 n.110.

EXPERT	75    of Wi-Fi access services, which are capable of delivering speeds comparable to wired broadband  Internet access services.
EXPERT	Making matters worse, the discussion of Wi-Fi services in the 2010  Open Internet Order is ambiguous and could be read to suggest that unlicensed services are  subject to the fixed broadband rules in all cases (notwithstanding the illogic of such an  outcome).248  If the Commission were to endorse such a reading in this renewed proceeding, it  would be entirely unworkable, as Wi-Fi services now are widely used to complement the  licensed wireless services offered by mobile broadband providers.249  The incoherence of such a  regime is evident from the fact that a single data stream could be subject to different regulatory  standards depending on whether it was being delivered via the mobile provider\u2019s licensed  wireless service or had been offloaded to an unlicensed Wi-Fi service.
EXPERT	Treating such services  differently only becomes less tenable as mobile broadband providers supplement their CMRS  networks with small cells that closely resemble Wi-Fi access points.250                                                    248   See 2010 Open Internet Order P 49 (explaining that the no-blocking and non- discrimination rules for fixed broadband services \u201cencompasses fixed wireless broadband  services (including services using unlicensed spectrum)\u201d).

EXPERT	Any such regime would almost  certainly be arbitrary and capricious.251  B.
EXPERT	The Commission Should Address Edge-Provider Conduct That Threatens  Internet Openness   In a similar vein, any Commission rules regarding Internet openness must address the  holistic nature of the Internet and the fact that ISPs are not entirely in control of the consumer  Internet experience.
EXPERT	While the NPRM tentatively concludes that any rules should not apply to  \u201cedge provider activities, such as the provision of content on the Internet,\u201d252 it would not  accomplish the Commission\u2019s objectives to focus solely on conduct by broadband ISPs.
EXPERT	It is well documented that a relatively concentrated group of large edge providers\u2014such  as Google, Netflix, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook\u2014have enormous and growing  power over consumers\u2019 ability to access the content of their choice on the Internet.253  As of  2013, \u201c50% of traffic c[ame] from 35 sites/services.\u201d254  Regulating only the conduct of ISPs,  many of which the Commission recognizes as \u201csmall entities,\u201d255 while declining to regulate  blocking or similar anticompetitive conduct carried out by these so-called \u201chyper-giants,\u201d would                                                    251   See, e.g., Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry.

EXPERT	And that is especially the case given that every major broadband provider has  committed to refrain from blocking access to online content and services,258 and no hyper-giant  has yet to make such a commitment.
EXPERT	In fact, in contrast to the largely theoretical threats to Internet openness from broadband  providers, these hyper-giants have demonstrated the ability and a willingness to harm other  companies and their customers by, for example, manipulating search results.259  Such conduct is  every bit as harmful to the \u201cvirtuous circle\u201d of innovation and broadband deployment as the  hypothesized conduct by broadband providers that justify the proposed rules.260  Under that  rationale, regulation of broadband providers to promote the open Internet is justified by its effect                                                    256   By the same token, if the Commission adopts its proposal to create an \u201combudsperson\u201d to  represent the interests of small entities on Internet openness issues, see id.

The Commission Should Not Expand This Proceeding To Encompass  Peering and Other Traffic-Exchange Arrangements  In contrast to mobile broadband and edge-provider services, peering and other  commercial arrangements governing the exchange of Internet traffic between networks do not  entail the provision of broadband Internet access service to end users and should not be  addressed in this proceeding.
EXPERT	Such arrangements have never been the focus of the Commission\u2019s  open Internet initiatives, or subject to any industry-specific regulation, for that matter.
EXPERT	And they  raise fundamentally different considerations.
EXPERT	The Commission therefore was correct to  tentatively conclude that it should exclude such arrangements from any new rules, as was the  case under the 2010 Open Internet Order.263  The Commission recently undertook to gather information on traffic-exchange  arrangements to gain a more complete understanding of the marketplace for peering  arrangements and transit and CDN services.264  Although NCTA expects that the information  provided by marketplace participants will confirm that the traffic-exchange marketplace is                                                    261   Verizon, 740 F.3d at 623.

EXPERT	79    robustly competitive and operating efficiently, if the Commission ultimately identifies any policy  concerns as a result of that review, it should address them separately from this rulemaking.
EXPERT	As  NCTA and others have explained, peering and transit arrangements present fundamentally  different considerations than the proposed open Internet rules.
EXPERT	Traffic-exchange arrangements  concern the economics of transporting Internet traffic across Internet backbones to broadband  providers\u2019 networks and exchange of that traffic with those networks.
EXPERT	They do not involve how  that traffic is delivered to the end-user once it arrives.
EXPERT	And they are negotiated based on a  variety of factors concerning the exchange of traffic between networks, including the amount of  traffic one network delivers to another, but not on the type, source, or content of that traffic.265   They do not concern end users\u2019 ability to access particular content, the quality of the broadband  Internet access service offered to end users, or the priority with which content is delivered to end  users over the last mile.
EXPERT	For these reasons, Chairman Wheeler undoubtedly was correct when he  recently explained that \u201cpeering is not a net neutrality issue.\u201d266  Notwithstanding some parties\u2019  self-serving efforts to muddy the waters,267 the Commission should not treat it as such.
EXPERT	Parties seeking to shoehorn traffic-exchange arrangements into this proceeding ignore  both history and the competitive realities of that distinct marketplace.
EXPERT	Since the birth of the  Internet, peering and interconnection agreements for Internet traffic have never been subject to                                                    265   See Dan Rayburn, How Transit Works, What It Costs & Why It\u2019s So Important,  Streaming Media, Feb. 24, 2014, available at  http://blog.streamingmedia.com/2014/02/transit-works-costs-important.html.

EXPERT	Regulation of such  complex relationships likely would prove immensely costly and complex.278  And without  perfect knowledge, regulators are likely to create opportunities for gamesmanship, diminish  incentives to efficiently share and minimize costs, and (consequently) increase the price of                                                    273   Global Crossing Ltd. and Level 3 Communications, Inc.

EXPERT	83    evidence that specialized services have been used to sidestep the Commission\u2019s rules or  produced anticompetitive effects, and they obviously have not displaced the public Internet.
EXPERT	In  fact, the Commission\u2019s Open Internet Advisory Committee (\u201cOIAC\u201d)\u2014assigned to \u201cclosely  monitor\u201d these services\u2014confirmed last year that the ability to offer multiple services over the  facilities used to deliver broadband Internet access service has been an important driver of  broadband investment.
EXPERT	As the OIAC explained, the business cases for expanding fiber optics or  for improving cable, for example, were \u201cfundamentally predicated upon the assumption that the  operator would offer multiple services\u201d over the same network, whether they be Title VI IP cable  services or yet-to-be-developed IP specialized services.286  It was only the projected value that  consumers would place on such multiple offerings that \u201cpromised an acceptable return on the  investment in the expansion of the overall broadband infrastructure.\u201d287    And, as the OIAC recognized, the same is true today.
EXPERT	In deciding to build out its new  Google Fiber cable service, for instance, Google executive Milo Medin told c|net that \u201cTV  service was a must in attracting residential customers.\u201d288  Google Fiber now offers 1 Gbps  broadband service and IP cable service in two different cities, with plans to expand to many  more.289  The same would be true for the offering of yet-to-be-developed specialized services,  which would further incentivize investment in broadband networks.
EXPERT	Departing from the Commission\u2019s restrained approach towards specialized services  would only risk undermining further investment incentives, as well as the valued benefits                                                    286   2013 OIAC Report at 67.

EXPERT	84    specialized services could provide, for no apparent gain.
EXPERT	In the 2010 Open Internet Order, the  Commission noted potential concerns that specialized services could be used to \u201cbypass[] open  Internet protections, supplant[] the open Internet, [or] enabl[e] anticompetitive conduct.\u201d290  But  there is no evidence that any of these hypothetical harms has occurred, or is even remotely  threatened.
EXPERT	To the contrary, the open Internet has thrived alongside specialized services.291    Moreover, the existing definition of  broadband Internet access service, which the D.C.
EXPERT	Circuit left untouched in Verizon, already includes any service \u201cthat is used to evade the  protections set forth in this part.\u201d292  Should a broadband provider ever attempt to use specialized  services to circumvent any new open Internet rules, that provision will provide ample authority  for Commission to act.
EXPERT	Without evidence of any concrete harms or indication that that authority  is insufficient to the task, it would be wholly unjustified and profoundly unwise to impose on  broadband providers anything more.
EXPERT	V. THE COMMISSION SHOULD CONFIRM THAT STATES ARE PREEMPTED  FROM REGULATING BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE    However the Commission ultimately decides to proceed, it should make clear that it has  exclusive jurisdiction to adopt open Internet rules and that the states are preempted from  adopting separate rules addressing the provision of broadband Internet access service.
EXPERT	As the  2010 Open Internet Order explained, \u201c[t]he Commission historically has recognized that services  carrying Internet traffic are jurisdictionally mixed, but generally subject to federal regulation.\u201d293                                                     290   2010 Open Internet Order P 112.

EXPERT	86    to subject broadband Internet access service to state common carrier regulation plainly would  conflict with the federal prohibition against the imposition of common carrier obligations on  information services, as the Verizon court recognized.297  But even in the event the Commission  sought to reclassify broadband Internet access under Title II\u2014leaving aside the many  overwhelming reasons why the Commission should not pursue that course\u2014the service would  remain inherently interstate in nature and would continue to be subject to exclusive federal  jurisdiction on that basis.298     Failing to preempt state authorities from imposing separate regulations on the provision  of broadband Internet access service would prove disastrous.
EXPERT	Absent a clear statement of  continued preemption by the Commission, some parties likely will take the position that Section  706(a), which refers to \u201cthe Commission and each State commission,\u201d299 authorizes states to  layer on additional Internet rules.

EXPERT	As it considers its new rules, the Commission  would do well to remember that the Internet has flourished in recent years under a consistently  light regulatory touch\u2014with unprecedented investment in network expansion and a broad  commitment from ISPs to Internet openness.
EXPERT	It should not risk reversing that trend now by  unnecessarily imposing heavy-handed common-carrier regulation under Title II that would be  both counterproductive and unlawful.
EXPERT	Instead, the Commission should carefully consider the  path set out by the D.C.

EXPERT	The NPRM\u2019s proposed Net Neutrality rules attempt to alleviate the  effects of an uncompetitive last mile by regulating broadband access, but Open Access strikes at  the heart of the problem by opening up the network to robust competition.
EXPERT	Open Access would  bring competition back to the Internet access market and consumer choice would be the primary  safeguard against abusive and discriminatory network practices.
EXPERT	Open Access was the Commission\u2019s prevailing policy for over 40 years.
EXPERT	The Computer  Inquiries laid the groundwork for a vibrant Internet access market and the Commission\u2019s policies  were successfully adopted around the world.
EXPERT	It was not until the Commission abandoned Open  Access and broadband competition evaporated that the need for Net Neutrality regulations  became apparent.
EXPERT	The Commission\u2019s decisions to classify broadband as an information service  were based on predictions that competition and infrastructure investment would flourish without  Open Access.
EXPERT	This proceeding provides the Commission the opportunity to reevaluate whether  Title I has produced the expected benefits.
EXPERT	The evidence is clear that it has not and i2Coalition  submits that now is the time to return to Open Access.
EXPERT	If the Commission does not reinstitute Open Access, then it should protect the open  Internet with enforceable no-blocking and anti-discrimination rules based on its Title II  authority.
EXPERT	Section 706 does not provide a solid legal foundation for the Commission\u2019s proposed  rules and paid prioritization arrangements would be counterproductive.
EXPERT	The incredible success  of the Internet is largely attributable to the fact that it has always been a level playing field.
EXPERT	iii  Minimal barriers to entry have allowed innovation to come from big and small players alike.
EXPERT	However, a bifurcated Internet where the wealthy and powerful can purchase preferential  treatment is anathema to the open Internet.
EXPERT	Paid prioritization also presents a dangerous threat to Internet privacy.
EXPERT	The only way that  broadband access providers can proactively prioritize edge providers\u2019 traffic is by monitoring the  content of their users\u2019 online communications.
EXPERT	The Commission should not sanction a  prioritization regime that requires Americans to sacrifice their privacy or that allows broadband  providers to discriminate against encryption tools.
EXPERT	Protecting the open Internet means establishing meaningful rules that stop discriminatory  practices.
EXPERT	Open Access, the policy i2Coalition recommends the Commission undertake, would  deter abuse through vibrant competition.
EXPERT	For 40 years, the Commission\u2019s Open Access rules  were the foundation of the information services market and they succeeded in fostering  competition, preventing discrimination, and incentivizing network investment.
EXPERT	These are the  results that Commission seeks in this proceeding and it can best achieve them by bringing back  Open Access.

EXPERT	THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT LIKELIHOOD THAT THE COURTS WILL FIND  THE PROPOSED NO-BLOCKING RULE AND COMMERCIALLY  REASONABLE STANDARD TO BE PER SE COMMON CARRIER  REQUIREMENTS.
EXPERT	The NPRM proposes three enforceable rules to safeguard Internet openness.3  The first is  an enhancement of the transparency rule established in the 2010 Open Internet Order.4  The  second is the reinstatement of the no-blocking rule adopted in the Open Internet Order, but  which was ultimately struck down by the D.C.

EXPERT	2014).
EXPERT	2  the three is designed to replace the Open Internet Order\u2019s anti-discrimination rule and is the  primary change of the proposed rules.
EXPERT	The Commission bases its authority to establish these new open Internet rules on Section  706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.6  The Verizon decision held that Section 706 grants  the Commission authority to implement rules to protect the open Internet, but struck down the  no-blocking and anti-discrimination rules as per se common carrier obligations.7  The D.C.
EXPERT	Circuit reasoned that because the Commission classified broadband Internet access service as a  non-common carrier unregulated information service in several decisions between 2000 and  2005, it cannot impose common carrier regulations on broadband Internet access providers.8 The  Commission has again proposed to use its Section 706 authority to reinstate these rules without  undertaking a reclassification of broadband Internet service or its underlying transmission  component so as to bring them under Title II.
EXPERT	But Verizon makes clear that Section 706-based  rules will only stand if they do not constitute per se common carriage.

EXPERT	It is very likely that the proposed no-blocking rule will be struck by the courts as  a per se common carrier requirement.
EXPERT	The NPRM proposes to reinstitute the original no-blocking rule that the D.C.
EXPERT	Circuit  struck down as a per se common carrier obligation.10  Not one change has been made to the text  of the rule.11  As proposed, the no-blocking rule will still require that broadband providers  transmit data associated with \u201clawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices\u201d  between their customers and edge providers at a prescribed minimum level of service.12    The NPRM asserts that reintroducing the rule in the same form will not constitute per se  common carrier regulation this time around because the Commission will allow broadband  providers and edge providers to enter into paid priority agreements.
EXPERT	The Commission believes  that this allowance for individualized bargaining for favored treatment will bring the rule within  the Commission\u2019s Section 706 authority because it allows for discriminatory terms, a non- common carrier attribute.13 The NPRM claims that the Verizon ruling invited the reintroduction of the no-blocking  rule with permission for broadband providers to negotiate terms for paid priority treatment.14   Unfortunately, this is an overly-optimistic reading of the ruling and the decision should not be  #2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; 9 i2Coalition believes that the Commission should simply embrace and apply its Title II authority, and then require  unbundling and a separate offer of the transmission component by returning to Computer Inquiry Open Access.
EXPERT	New  competitive entry in the Internet access market will then deter the evils identified in the NPRM.
EXPERT	If the Commission  does not return to Open Access then i2Coalition concurs with many of the commentators who recommend reliance  on Title II to regulate the currently non-competitive Internet access market through meaningful and effective no- blocking and non-discrimination rules.

EXPERT	The court refused to consider this argument because it was not in the  original order or briefed.
EXPERT	The portion of the decision the NPRM cites as support for the  currently-proposed no-blocking rule was instead merely a recitation of the oral argument made  by the Commission.
EXPERT	At no point does the decision actually state that a no-blocking rule could be  implemented under the Commission\u2019s Section 706 authority if only it is combined with  individualized negotiations for priority.
EXPERT	And even if it had, such a statement would have been  made without the benefit of briefing.
EXPERT	To say the least, the Commission is on very tenuous  grounds basing its approach on the belief that this sort of no-blocking rule has already been  preapproved in Verizon.
EXPERT	The Verizon decision shows that this new effort would be analyzed primarily against the  Supreme Court\u2019s 1979 decision in Midwest Video II.15  Under that precedent the new rule will  almost certainly be found to still be a per se common carrier obligation.16  The Verizon decision  found the Open Internet Order\u2019s no-blocking rule to be \u201cindistinguishable\u201d from the no-blocking  rule in Midwest Video II because both require the regulated entities to carry the content of third  parties to their customers.
EXPERT	In both cases, the service provider could otherwise block content  absent the rule, which, according the court, effectively transfers control over the transmissions to  the third parties.17  In both Midwest Video II and Verizon, the no-blocking rule constituted a  minimum level of service that third parties received free of charge.
EXPERT	Both conditions are common  carrier obligations and both remain present in the NPRM\u2019s no-blocking rule.
EXPERT	This iteration of the  no-blocking rule will produce the same Section 706 result as the last iteration and for the same  reasons.

EXPERT	5  The addition of negotiated, commercially reasonable paid priority service does not  change this analysis.
EXPERT	Prioritization would be completely separate from the mandatory minimum  level of service that constituted per se common carriage in Verizon.
EXPERT	The no-blocking rule sets  the floor below which the broadband provider\u2019s service cannot fall.
EXPERT	Priority treatment, on the  other hand, would simply constitute the purchase of adjunct, premium service on top of the  minimum level of service.
EXPERT	Common carriers have always had the ability to negotiate individual  agreements for supplemental and priority services above standard minimum levels of service  without affecting common carriage obligations.18    Nor would the addition of paid prioritization to the non-blocking rule be analogous to the  Commission\u2019s data roaming rule, which the D.C.
EXPERT	Circuit found to be a non-common carrier  obligation in Cellco.19  The data roaming rule does not require free access and in fact does not  require a minimum level of service at all.
EXPERT	The \u201csubstantial room for individualized bargaining\u201d  central to the data roaming rule is significantly curtailed by the present proposal to impose a no  cost \u201cminimum level of service\u201d option for edge providers.20  The no-blocking rule also severely  curtails broadband providers\u2019 right to \u201cmake individualized decisions, in particular cases,  whether and on what terms to deal.\u201d21  Minimum terms are dictated by the Commission and  decisions regarding \u201cwhether\u201d to serve edge providers are foreclosed.
EXPERT	The contemplated option  of providing an additional service \u2013 presumably for a charge \u2013 does not change the fact that the  proposed rule would still require a basic service, without any room for negotiations about  whether, or on what terms, that service will be provided.
EXPERT	This plainly constitutes the imposition  #2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; 18 See, e.g., Letter from Robert W.

EXPERT	The Verizon decision struck down the Open Internet Order\u2019s no-blocking rule because it  mandated that all edge providers receive a minimum level of access, which is a hallmark of  common carriage.22  Allowing the provision of negotiated preferential treatment above this  minimum level of service does nothing to actually eliminate the underlying per se common  carrier obligation.
EXPERT	If the NPRM\u2019s rules are adopted as proposed, the D.C.
EXPERT	Circuit will again  apply the Midwest Video II holding in the inevitable appeal and the no-blocking rule will almost  certainly be struck down for the same reasons it was rejected in Verizon.
EXPERT	B.
EXPERT	There is a significant likelihood that the proposed commercially reasonable rule  will be struck by the courts as a per se common carrier requirement.
EXPERT	The NPRM has replaced the Open Internet Order\u2019s anti-discrimination rule with a  general prohibition of commercially unreasonable practices by broadband Internet access  providers.23  This new rule replicates the Commission\u2019s Data Roaming Order and the attendant  data roaming rule in many respects.24  The data roaming rule was held by the D.C.
EXPERT	Circuit to not  constitute a common carrier obligation because it allowed \u201csubstantial room for individualized  bargaining and discrimination in terms.\u201d25  However, the new commercially reasonable standard  significantly expands upon the data roaming rule and may very well be held to include so many  marks of common carriage as to be outside the Commission\u2019s Section 706 authority.

EXPERT	25 Cellco, 700 F.3d at 548.
EXPERT	7  The commercially reasonable standards proposed in the NPRM go well beyond the scope  of the data roaming rule in several important respects.
EXPERT	For instance, the data roaming rule  imposes an obligation for wireless carriers to undertake commercially reasonable actions in only  one situation, namely negotiations over data roaming agreements.
EXPERT	The NPRM\u2019s commercially  reasonable standard, however, would apply to all actions involved in the provision of broadband  service.26  This would include relations with customers, network management, and interactions  with edge providers.
EXPERT	One aspect that the D.C.
EXPERT	Circuit found determinative when holding that the Data  Roaming Order did not impose common carriage obligations was that the rule includes no  presumption of reasonableness.27  The Commission set neither an upper limit nor a lower limit  outside of which a data roaming agreement became commercially unreasonable.
EXPERT	Instead the  Commission left it to the market to determine the range of acceptable terms and rates.
EXPERT	The  NPRM\u2019s commercially reasonable rule does not do this, however.
EXPERT	Instead, the Commission  presumes that providing the mandatory minimum level of service free of charge to edge  providers is reasonable.
EXPERT	This sets a floor below which negotiations for priority delivery will  never drop.
EXPERT	By imposing a no-blocking rule and a minimum level of free service for edge providers,  the Commission is mandating \u201cgenerally applicable terms\u201d for broadband.28  Every customer  will have access to every edge provider and every edge provider will secure unblocked  transmission of their traffic free of charge.
EXPERT	It is likely that only the largest edge providers will  negotiate prioritized treatment and the vast majority will instead make do with the generally  #2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; 26 NPRM at P 116.

EXPERT	Most edge providers will forego negotiations for paid  priority treatment for many reasons, including cost and traffic volume.
EXPERT	They will accept the  minimum level of service available to them.
EXPERT	Data roaming, however, cannot occur at all, at any  level, until there are negotiations and an agreement.
EXPERT	An agreement is a mandatory prerequisite to  obtaining access of any kind.
EXPERT	In these respects, the NPRM\u2019s commercially reasonable rule  significantly departs from the Data Roaming Order.29 The NPRM\u2019s commercially reasonable standard creates substantially less room for  individualized bargaining and discrimination in terms than the Data Roaming Order.
EXPERT	The Cellco  decision noted that the Data Roaming Order \u201cbears some marks of common carriage,\u201d but  deferred to the Commission because those marks did not so predominate as to relegate wireless  carriers to common carrier status.30  By eliminating the mandatory negotiation process, creating a  presumption of reasonableness, setting generally applicable terms, and proposing to apply the  commercially reasonable standard as a general rule for broadband providers, the NPRM bears far  more marks of common carriage than the data roaming rule.
EXPERT	There is a significant likelihood  that this expansion of per se common carrier obligations will be found to so predominate as to  relegate broadband providers to common carriers in violation of the Commission\u2019s Section 706  authority.
EXPERT	C. The Commission should not risk years of regulatory and marketplace  uncertainty by implementing rules with dubious legal authority.
EXPERT	Section 706 does not provide solid legal authority for the Commission to implement the  no-blocking rule and the prohibition on commercially unreasonable practices.
EXPERT	The latter is being  proposed in order to impose a non-discrimination rule while not calling it common carriage.

EXPERT	9  allowance for individually negotiated priority agreements only affects the upper bounds of edge  provider access to broadband networks, but leaves the common carrier minimum level of service  untouched.
EXPERT	Similarly, the significant expansion of the commercially reasonable standard risks so  predominating broadband service as to constitute per se common carriage.
EXPERT	The Commission\u2019s  efforts bear a very high likelihood that one of the two rules, if not both, will be struck yet again.
EXPERT	Should the Commission\u2019s open Internet rules be vacated for a third time, the result will  be a decade and a half of market and regulatory uncertainty, as well as a non-neutral Internet.
EXPERT	Those are years that the broadband market cannot get back and in which the United States  became increasingly uncompetitive with other developed countries.
EXPERT	The Commission should not  knowingly set out on tenuous legal authority to protect the open Internet.
EXPERT	To do so invites legal  challenge and forecloses the type of certainty that businesses and investors require.
EXPERT	This is  especially unwise when the Commission plainly has the ability to accomplish the same policy  objectives on well-established, indisputable legal authority under Title II.
EXPERT	III.
EXPERT	PAID PRIORITIZATION AND THE COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE STANDARD WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT EDGE PROVIDERS.
EXPERT	The NPRM has proposed to replace the Open Internet Order\u2019s anti-discrimination rule  with a commercially reasonable standard and permission for broadband Internet access providers  to enter into negotiated paid prioritization agreements with edge providers.31  The Commission  believes that the combination of these two changes brings the proposed rules within the  Commission\u2019s Section 706 authority.32  These rules, therefore, were not developed and proposed  for the positive benefits they would bring consumers, but rather as jurisdictional hook.

EXPERT	32 Id at P 118.
EXPERT	10  Paid prioritization on the last mile is a significant and unnecessary change to the way that  Internet access has traditionally been provisioned.
EXPERT	Allowing edge providers to purchase  preferential treatment, and therefore a higher-quality connection to end users, dramatically  changes one of the Internet\u2019s most beneficial features; the level playing field.
EXPERT	The Chairman\u2019s  statement is adamant that prioritization will not lead to a fast lane-slow lane dichotomy.33   However, bandwidth is a zero-sum resource.
EXPERT	Any increase in the share of bandwidth to certain  edge providers necessarily reduces the share available to the non-favored edge providers.
EXPERT	A paid prioritization regime will benefit broadband access providers and established edge  providers, but hurt small edge providers, competition, innovation, and ultimately consumers.
EXPERT	Preferential treatment for those edge providers that can afford premium service provides a  competitive advantage against all non-prioritized edge providers.
EXPERT	In a paid priority system,  wealthy edge providers will be able to prevail over competitors by out-spending them, rather  than by creating superior products.
EXPERT	This will further entrench the established and presently- successful edge providers at the expense of new and small competitors.
EXPERT	Start-ups that require  priority service may not be able to bring their product to market without significant outside  investment and investors will be affected by the increased equity needs of entrepreneurs.
EXPERT	All of  these negative effects are incompatible with the concept of an open and dynamic Internet.
EXPERT	Instead, a prioritized Internet is one that favors the status quo over innovation and change.
EXPERT	The commercially reasonable standard also threatens to further entangle unregulated edge  providers in the Commission\u2019s regulatory regime.
EXPERT	The NPRM proposes to enforce the  commercially reasonable standard through the Commission\u2019s formal complaint process.34  This  means that the Commission is delegating watchdog responsibilities to edge providers with no  #2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; 33 Id.

EXPERT	The prospect of hiring attorneys to litigate a  potentially years-long formal complaint at the Commission whenever faced with an unreasonable  practice is an incentive not to venture into the edge provider business.

EXPERT	Instead these factors water-down the Open Internet Order\u2019s anti- discrimination rule in order to sustain a claim to Section 706 authority.

EXPERT	IV.
EXPERT	TITLE II RECLASSIFICATION OF THE BROADBAND TRANSMISSION  COMPONENT AND REINSTITUTION OF OPEN ACCESS WOULD BETTER  PROTECT AGAINST THE HARMS OF AN UNCOMPETITIVE LAST MILE.
EXPERT	The fundamental dilemma that the Commission faced with the Internet Policy Statement,  in the Open Internet Order, and which it faces in this proceeding is that it wants to impose a  common carrier principle upon non-common carriers.
EXPERT	\u201cNet Neutrality\u201d is a euphemism for the  combination of common carrier prohibitions against blocking and discrimination.35  Twice the  Commission has failed to lawfully impose Net Neutrality obligations on unregulated broadband  providers, yet it is once again attempting to fit a square peg in a round hole.
EXPERT	Instead, the  Commission should reclassify the transmission component of broadband Internet access and  open it up to competition.
EXPERT	In other words, bring back Open Access.
EXPERT	The need for Net Neutrality regulations arises entirely because predecessor Commissions  between 1999 and 2007 allowed telephone and cable companies to close off competitive access  to bottleneck broadband infrastructure and services, thereby eliminating broadband Internet  #2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; 35 The avowed purpose is to prohibit or limit access provider discretion that is inconsistent with user choice or  societal goals.
EXPERT	i2Coalition agrees that this is necessary precisely because access providers have the incentive and  ability to act in ways contrary to the public interest and user choice in many ways and have so acted, just as the  Commission has recently recognized.
EXPERT	In other words, i2Coalition agrees that blocking and discrimination are evils to  be avoided.
EXPERT	The point here is that per se common carriage through Open Access or some form of Net Neutrality is  the only way the Commission can effectively eliminate unreasonable discrimination in access to or the use of  broadband transmission.
EXPERT	12  access competition.
EXPERT	Thus, the telephone and cable companies were effectively granted a duopoly  over wireline broadband access.
EXPERT	Without competition and consumer choice to reign in harmful  broadband practices, the Commission has sought to protect American Internet users with Net  Neutrality rules for the past nine years.
EXPERT	The Commission has now properly recognized that the duopoly providers have both the  incentive and the means to act in ways contrary to the public interest.36  In an effort to rectify  these evils, the Commission chose to regulate Internet access providers through Net Neutrality  rules, rather than taking the more logical step of re-opening the network by returning to the Open  Access rules that allowed the Internet to flourish from the beginning.
EXPERT	The Internet developed  into an open platform because the essential underlying facilities and services were themselves  open to competition.
EXPERT	It was the move away from Open Access and competition on the  underlying network that ultimately necessitated this NPRM.
EXPERT	The Commission\u2019s explanation for excluding dial-up Internet access from Title I  reclassification the Open Internet Order directly illustrates that this is so.
EXPERT	The Commission  explained that competitive forces and regulation of the underlying transmission component  protected dial-up service from monopoly abuses and the Order\u2019s Net Neutrality rules were  therefore unnecessary.
EXPERT	[T]he easy ability to switch among competing dial-up Internet access services.
EXPERT	Moreover, the underlying dial-up Internet access service is subject to protections  under Title II of the Communications Act.
EXPERT	The Commission\u2019s interpretation of  those protections has resulted in a market for dial-up Internet access that does not  present the same concerns as the market for broadband Internet access.37    This statement acknowledges that Open Access and a competitive marketplace is preferable to  Net Neutrality rules.

EXPERT	The  transmission component should be isolated and brought back under Title II.
EXPERT	The Commission  will then have firm ground upon which to rest its rules preventing the evils that have been  identified in the NPRM.
EXPERT	i2Coalition suggests that the Commission does not have to directly regulate the bundled  Internet access product.
EXPERT	That product can plausibly remain an unregulated, non-common carrier  information service \u2013 even when offered by the infrastructure owner or an affiliate \u2013 so long as  the transmission component is available to unaffiliated parties on just, reasonable and non- discriminatory terms, equal to those applicable its affiliate.
EXPERT	While i2Coalition believes that  structural separation is preferable, it is not mandatory.

EXPERT	Past Commissions took these actions despite the fact that the current Communications  Act was almost entirely premised on competitive access to unbundled monopoly or duopoly  transmission facilities, the epitome of Open Access.
EXPERT	Much of the rest of the world followed the  original American model and embraced Open Access \u2013 probably because the U.S. Government  urged them to do so41 \u2013 and they have retained it even after the Commission reversed course.
EXPERT	That is one of the major reasons there is far more competition, better and faster Internet  capabilities, and lower prices abroad.
EXPERT	There is not a universally-accepted definition of Open Access.
EXPERT	The Commission has  equated Open Access with multiple-ISP access in the context of cable networks, but the concept  of Open Access truly arose in the Computer Inquiries.
EXPERT	In particular, Open Access was the  shorthand term for the ability of unaffiliated enhanced service providers to obtain  telecommunications inputs from LECs in the form of \u201cOpen Network Architecture\u201d or \u201cONA.\u201d   However, the Open Access concept is not unique to communications.
EXPERT	For example, the energy  industry still operates under some variants of an Open Access regime.42   For fixed networks, Open Access policies usually take the form of regulated access, such  as local loop unbundling, dark, grey and lit fiber and other wholesale access products.

EXPERT	Policy makers and regulators in most countries realize that these infrastructure elements  represent a major barrier for the entry of alternative ISPs without mandatory access.
EXPERT	Net Neutrality is not Open Access.
EXPERT	Indeed, Tim Wu, who is credited with crafting the  Net Neutrality concept, took great pains to distinguish Net Neutrality from Open Access in his  original paper that introduced the topic.43  Open Access is about opening essential infrastructure  to competition.
EXPERT	Net Neutrality accepts that there is no Open Access, and regulates Internet  access rather than the essential facilities.
EXPERT	The 2005 Commission concluded that retaining Open Access as a regulatory policy  would not provide sufficient incentives for the telephone companies and cable companies to  invest in broadband transmission.44  They underappreciated the fact that eliminating Open  Access meant that the incumbents would obtain monopoly control of both the transmission  market and the adjacent Internet access market, and both would be susceptible to abuses of  market power.
EXPERT	The 2010 Commission then applied Net Neutrality as a palliative band-aid to  mask the fact that eliminating Open Access removed the possibility for intramodal competition  in the Internet access market.

EXPERT	Wu\u2019s paper appears  to equate \u201cOpen Access\u201d with \u201cstructural separation.\u201d  See, e.g., id.
EXPERT	at 148 (\u201cThe term open-access is used in many  different ways; it generally refers to a structural requirement that would prevent broadband operators from bundling  broadband service with Internet access from in-house Internet service providers.\u201d) Open access, however, is possible  even in the absence of structural separation.
EXPERT	For example, Computer III replaced structural separation with  accounting safeguards, but retained Open Access.
EXPERT	Computer Inquiry allowed the incumbents to bundle their own  offering, so long as they had an unbundled offering available to third party providers.
EXPERT	44 See, e.g., Appropriate Framework for Broadband Access to the Internet Over Wireline Facilities, 20 FCC Rcd  14853, 14855, 14860, and 14877-878, PP 1, 19, and 44 (2005) (DSL Reclassification Order).
EXPERT	17  It is time for the Commission to bring back Open Access and competition in the  broadband market.
EXPERT	Net Neutrality to date has not cured the disease, and it presents insuperable  legal and practical problems.
EXPERT	2.
EXPERT	Forty years ago, the Commission led the world and created a new  Open Access framework.
EXPERT	Over 40 years ago, the Commission instituted Open Access primarily through the original  service unbundling rules established in the seminal Computer Inquiry trilogy.
EXPERT	Other  competition-enhancing efforts dealing with customer premises equipment and inside wiring were  adopted by Congress and approved by the courts.
EXPERT	All of these actions were based on Open  Access concepts.
EXPERT	Other federal agencies applied the same concepts to the energy industry,  resulting in tremendous competition and consumer benefits.45  This set the stage for the  explosive growth of the Internet and much of the world followed the Commission\u2019s lead.
EXPERT	The Computer Inquiries\u2019 Open Access model was deregulatory, but did not eschew Title  II regulation where widespread competition was not truly feasible.
EXPERT	The first step was to isolate  monopoly telecommunications components, and impose regulation on the monopoly activity \u2013  and that activity only.
EXPERT	The regulations made these non-competitive components available to  users and potential entrants in order to allow competition to thrive where it was possible.46  The  #2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; 45 Electric and gas transmission Open Access has reduced wholesale prices for energy, and the cost reduction input  has flowed to retail customers.
EXPERT	On the electric side it has much contributed to the growth of solar and wind power as  an alternative to carbon fuels and nuclear.
EXPERT	The same concept has also directly benefitted retail energy customers,  because the principle has also allowed retail customers to \u201cattach\u201d solar and gas self-generation to the electric grid,  allowing them to self-generate but also receive standby and back-up and sell excess energy.
EXPERT	In many respects this is  akin to the original Policy Statement that \u201cconsumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that do not  harm the network.\u201d  Appropriate Framework for Broadband Access to the Internet over Wireline Facilities, 20 FCC  Rcd 14986, 14988 (2005).
EXPERT	Consumer attachment rights arose from Hush-a-Phone, Hush-a-Phone Corp. v. U.S., 238  F.2d 266 (D.C. Cir.
EXPERT	1956), and Carterphone, In the Matter of Use of the Carterfone Device, 13 F.C.C.2d 420  (1968), but the Computer Inquiries also advanced attachment rights by deregulating CPE and inside wire while  maintaining regulations enforcing the attachment right, including the Part 68 process.
EXPERT	46 Although Internet access certainly depends on transmission service inputs, it is not solely raw transmission.
EXPERT	Other  arguably non-telecommunications functions are sometimes offered along with the transmission.
EXPERT	Internet access is a  distinct, secondary service that can plausibly be said to reside in an \u201cadjacent\u201d market.
EXPERT	The question, however, is  whether the bundled output is still telecommunications.
EXPERT	If one uses the Computer Inquiries parlance, the decision to   18  second step was to deregulate value-added enhanced service markets that rely on  telecommunications inputs, but are not themselves telecommunications and can be competitive if  bottleneck telecommunications inputs are available on a nondiscriminatory basis.
EXPERT	The Computer Inquiries spurred the rise of unregulated value-added networks that had  specific rights to access facilities, such as local plant, so they could provide \u201cenhanced services.\u201d  Those decisions directly and inexorably led to the rise of the Internet.47  The Commission itself \u2013  until relatively recently \u2013 repeatedly emphasized that the Internet as we know it would not exist  but for the Computer Inquiry Open Access rules.48 #2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; be made depends on whether the telecommunications component is \u201ccontaminated\u201d by and subsumed within the  bundled output.
EXPERT	That is the basic perspective used in the Cable Modem Declaratory Ruling and then leveraged into  the DSL Reclassification Order.
EXPERT	A correct application of the Computer Inquiries would have resulted in application  of \u201cadjunct to basic\u201d rather than \u201ccontamination\u201d to most of the major providers since they were carriers and  facilities-based.
EXPERT	The Commission long ago explained \u2013 for good reason \u2013 that the contamination doctrine cannot  and should not be used for facilities-based entities that engage in common carrier activity.
EXPERT	See IDCMA Frame  Relay, Memorandum Opinion & Order, 10 FCC Rcd 13717, 13719-720, and 13723-24, PP 17-18 and 42-45 (\u201cAT&T  cannot avoid its Computer II and Computer III obligations under the auspices of the contamination doctrine, which  applies only to nonfacilities-based service providers\u201d).
EXPERT	As we explain below, the Commission should have used  \u201cadjunct to basic\u201d for the preponderance of cable modem providers, all of the major DSL providers and even the  broadband wireless providers that are CMRS because they were in fact common carriers, at least in part, and they  are facilities-based.
EXPERT	47 The entities the NPRM labels edge providers are predominately non-carriers, and most do not own extensive  transmission networks.
EXPERT	Some do have some privately-owned transmission, but they still much resemble the \u201cValue  Added Networks\u201d discussed in Computer Inquiry although their primary function is no longer protocol conversion.
EXPERT	All exist entirely as a result of Computer Inquiry because that set of proceedings ensured these entities would have  Open Access to bottleneck transmission and would not suffer unnecessary regulation.
EXPERT	48 A fine collection of such observations appears in The FCC and the Unregulation of the Internet, FCC OPP  Working Paper, July 31, 1999, available at http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/OPP/working_papers/oppwp31.pdf:    Open access across the telecommunications network has driven the deployment of innovative and  inexpensive Internet access services.
EXPERT	\u2026 the growth and continued success of the Internet, and the  ability of market forces to sustain and encourage that growth, can be attributed to one basic  attribute: the openness of both the Internet and the underlying telecommunications infrastructure.
EXPERT	\u2026 To the extent that the Internet has relied on the openness of this nation\u2019s communications  infrastructure to reach all corners of this nation, this ingredient in its success has not been an  accident.
EXPERT	The FCC has taken numerous steps since the early days of the telecommunications data  services industry three decades ago to permit competitive forces, not government regulation, to  drive the success of that industry.
EXPERT	As discussed in greater detail below, the success of the Internet  today is, in part, a direct result of those policies.
EXPERT	\u2026 First, the Commission noted that data  processing services required common carrier facilities and services as necessary inputs, and  common carriers that offered their own data services would have the ability and incentive to  discriminate against unaffiliated data service providers by denying them access to fairly priced  telecommunications services.
EXPERT	Second, the Commission noted that common carriers might  improperly cross-subsidize their unregulated data processing services with rate-regulated common  carrier revenues.
EXPERT	19  Net Neutrality is perceived as needed today only because the Commission decided to  abandon the prior Open Access rules that had been in place for almost 40 years and had served as  the foundation upon which the open Internet was able grow into a primary communications tool.
EXPERT	This decision to eliminate Open Access created the underlying problems the Commission now  seeks to fix because it produced monopoly or duopoly control over transmission.
EXPERT	3.
EXPERT	Congress adopted, applied and extended Open Access in the 1996  amendments.
EXPERT	Congress adopted and reaffirmed the Computer Inquiry service unbundling model in the  1996 amendments, and then further extended it through the interconnection and facility  unbundling requirements in SS 251 and 252.
EXPERT	But soon after 1996, the Commission abandoned  the Open Access policies it had established by serially closing the network, despite Congress\u2019s  clear policy supporting Open Access.
EXPERT	The 1996 amendments adopted and reaffirmed Computer Inquiry in several ways.
EXPERT	First,  the definitions in S 153 employed the Open Access model by distinguishing between  telecommunications services offered by carriers and information services offered by non- carriers.
EXPERT	The former retained Title II common carrier obligations, but the latter received virtually  no regulation.
EXPERT	Congress maintained Open Access by preserving existing \u201cinformation access\u201d  obligations in S 251(g), as well as the right to attach end-user equipment that has been properly  registered.
EXPERT	Section 257(a) required the Commission to identify and remove entry barriers facing  information service providers, and also addressed \u201cprovision of parts or services to providers of  \u2026 information services.\u201d  Second, Bell Operating Companies\u2019 pathways for entry into the  information service market (interLATA information services, electronic publishing and alarm  monitoring), which were still denied them at the time, employed both structural separation and   20  accounting safeguards quite similar to those arising from Computer II and Computer III,  including nondiscriminatory access by unaffiliated information service providers.49    Congress used a modified Computer Inquiry Open Access framework to require  \u201cinterconnection\u201d and \u201cfacility unbundling\u201d as a means for competitive carriers to enter and  participate in the market.
EXPERT	The entirety of Sections 251 and 252 is modeled after Computer  Inquiry Open Access concepts.
EXPERT	Section 251(a) and (c)(2) require interconnection between  ILECs and competing carriers.
EXPERT	Section 251(c)(3) grants competitive carrier access to underlying  facilities and infrastructure through facilities unbundling.
EXPERT	Nothing in those provisions provides  even a hint that broadband was to be excluded, or that use of a different protocol would remove  anything from coverage.
EXPERT	Instead, Section 251(h)(2) allows the Commission to bring cable  companies within the regime.
EXPERT	Enhanced/information service providers formed a significant part of the customer base  for the CLEC industry.
EXPERT	Past Commissions allowed the incumbents to undercut this relationship  in a host of ways and seize the Internet access market all for themselves.
EXPERT	That is why we are  where we are today.
EXPERT	4.
EXPERT	The Commission serially closed the Open Access network between  1999 and 2007.
EXPERT	The Commission decision to abandon Open Access is often said to stem from the Cable  Modem Declaratory Ruling.50  But it actually started before then.
EXPERT	Since 1999, the Commission  #2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; 49 See 47 U.S.C.

EXPERT	\u2026 [T]here is now  absolutely no obligation to provide competitive access to any broadband facilities\u2013from fiber-to- the-home to fiber-to-the curb to packetized functions of hybrid loops to packetized switching  capabilities\u2013at just and reasonable rates.
EXPERT	[The majority] conclude[s] that the public interest is  served by retreating to a policy of non-competition and last mile monopoly control.
EXPERT	I cannot  support such conclusions nor the underlying analysis.
EXPERT	\u2026  One problem here is that the majority gets so carried away with its vision of the country\u2019s telecom  future that they act like it is already here, that competition is everywhere flourishing, and that  intermodal competition is already ubiquitous reality.
EXPERT	But their cheerful blindness to stubborn  market reality actually pushes farther into the future the kind of competitive telecom world they  say they want.
EXPERT	\u2026   23  policy decisions, but it can and should undo the damage by reinstating Open Access and  reinvigorating competition for Internet access.
EXPERT	5.
EXPERT	The Commission also eliminated UNE-based Open Access.
EXPERT	The Commission at first made significant, but incomplete efforts to apply Open Access  principles to UNEs.
EXPERT	The Local Competition Order declined to subject packet switches to UNE  access requirements and ruled that collocation did not extend to equipment used to provide  enhanced services.
EXPERT	The Commission did allow multifunction equipment supporting both  conventional telephone and enhanced services so long as that equipment was necessary to  providing conventional telephone service.
EXPERT	The Commission also held that any company  obtaining interconnection or UNE access to provide telecommunications services could offer  information services through the same arrangement.
EXPERT	The order mandated UNE access to all  loops connecting central offices to end users, including the loops used to provide DSL and  obligated incumbent local telephone company to fulfill any requests to condition existing loops  to make them DSL-compatible.61  A subsequent order confirmed that collocation included  multifunction equipment that could be used to provide both voice and data services.62  Perhaps  most importantly, the Line Sharing Order mandated UNE access to the high frequency portion of  the loop used to carry DSL so that two competitors could provide services over the same loop,  #2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; The lack of analysis in this proceeding\u2013and in the Commission\u2019s approach to broadband generally  \u2013 amounts to a regulatory policy of crossing our fingers and hoping competition will somehow  magically burst forth.
EXPERT	\u2026 if we want to enter the brave new world of broadband, we need to move  away from our current course.

EXPERT	The Supreme Court\u2019s decision  in AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utilities Board remanded the Commission\u2019s initial UNE access rules  because the Supreme Court held the Commission had construed the \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201cimpair\u201d  standards too broadly.64  On remand, the Commission reiterated that incumbent local telephone  companies must condition DSL loops upon request.
EXPERT	Although UNE access to loops generally  included all attached electronics, the Commission nonetheless again specifically excepted packet  switches and DSLAMs, based on the notion that granting UNE access to them would deter  investment in a nascent market.
EXPERT	The Commission did permit UNE access to DSLAMs located in  remote terminals that were too small to permit physical collocation, but to date this \u201cright\u201d was  rarely actualized into viable and functional CLEC arrangements \u2013 largely because of ILEC  roadblocks.65 In 2000, the D.C.

EXPERT	In 2002, the Commission issued the Wireline Broadband NPRM, which  tentatively concluded that DSL and other broadband services provided by local telephone  companies constituted \u201cinformation services\u201d not subject to Title II tariffing and common  carriage requirements, and sought comment on whether to modify or eliminate Computer Inquiry  rules.69 Later in 2002, the Commission detariffed DSL services that SBC offered through its  separate subsidiary.70 In 2002, the D.C.

EXPERT	26  high-capacity loops from the list of S 251(c)(3) UNEs.73 The Commission granted forbearance  from 271 requirements for broadband in 2004.74 In sum, the situation today is that an independent ISP has no means to obtain high- capacity loops from an ILEC or a cable company under nondiscriminatory and reasonable terms,  either directly or through a competitive carrier.
EXPERT	There is no wholesale access to network  infrastructure or services provided on fair and reasonable terms, for which there is some degree  of transparency and non-discrimination.
EXPERT	There is no mandatory regulated access, such as local  loop unbundling, and other wholesale access products such as dark fiber or next layer (e.g.,  bitstream) are unavailable, except by leave and on adhesive \u201cnegotiated\u201d terms reluctantly  offered by a cable or telephone company.
EXPERT	Open Access is gone, and with it, the independent ISP industry that originally brought the  Internet to the masses.
EXPERT	The fact is the Commission\u2019s predecessors made a series of decisions that  led to the elimination of a source of robust competition and beneficial economic incentives.

EXPERT	Commission predictions that closing the networks would lead to  ubiquitous broadband and not threaten the open Internet have  proven incorrect.
EXPERT	When the Commission classified cable broadband Internet access and DSL Internet  access as information services, it predicted that broadband competition would take off as a result.
EXPERT	The DSL Reclassification Order explained that deregulation was appropriate because  competition amongst independent ISPs was flourishing and would continue to thrive.75  The  Commission also believed that intermodal competition would blossom, leading to additional  investment and reduced prices for consumers.76  This expectation was not merely peripheral to  the decision to classify broadband as an information service, it was the primary basis for Title I  classification.77  Yet nearly a decade since the Cable Modem Declaratory Ruling was issued, at a  time when the Commission expected broadband competition to be in full bloom, the current  NPRM instead acknowledges that Americans have \u201climited choice between broadband providers  in many areas of the country.\u201d78    Not only did these expectations fail to materialize, but the classification decisions based  upon these expectations have proven counterproductive.
EXPERT	The competition that existed at the time  of the orders has vanished.
EXPERT	In 1998, there were between five thousand and seven thousand  independent ISPs offering Internet access to the American public,79 but today almost all of them  are gone.
EXPERT	The independent ISPs are the collateral damage of the Commission\u2019s misjudgment  that, in a deregulatory environment, \u201cwireline platform providers will find it necessary and  #2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; 75 Appropriate Framework for Broadband Access to the Internet Over Wireline Facilities, 20 FCC Rcd 14853,  14907, P 100 (2005) (DSL Reclassification Order).

EXPERT	All of the problems that the NPRM attempts to remedy arise from an uncompetitive  broadband market.
EXPERT	If American Internet users had the option to vote with their feet, the  marketplace would punish harmful behavior.
EXPERT	Users themselves could impose neutrality  requirements by ditching broadband providers with abusive practices.
EXPERT	A Comcast decision to  inject reset headers into its users\u2019 BitTorrent traffic would be weighed against the loss of  customers and shareholder fury, rather than the merits of challenging the Commission\u2019s Section  706 authority in court.
EXPERT	Not only did the Commission miss the mark on its prediction that intramodal competition  would thrive, but it also misjudged the likelihood of intermodal competition.
EXPERT	The DSL  Reclassification Order argued that \u201cother existing and developing platforms, such as satellite and  wireless, and even broadband over power line in certain locations, indicat[e] that broadband  Internet access services in the future will not be limited to cable modem and DSL service.\u201d82   However, none of these technologies have developed into a competitive threat to the telephone  and cable companies.
EXPERT	Wireless broadband has developed its own niche, but has failed to become  an alternative for wired Internet access because of limitations inherent to broadcasting data over  #2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; 80 DSL Reclassification Order, 20 FCC Rcd 14853, 14895 P 79.

EXPERT	Eighty-three percent of smartphone owners continue to maintain their wired  home broadband connections, indicating that wireless is not a viable replacement.83  If the  average American Internet user were to even attempt to substitute a wireless connection for their  wired connection, overage charges would drive their bill to more than $800 per month.84  Indeed,  the fact that the NPRM proposes to allow non-neutral wireless broadband service shows that it is  not yet a fully substitutable and competitive equivalent for wired service.
EXPERT	In addition to unrealistic expectations regarding competition, the Commission also  incorrectly predicted that infrastructure investment would take off.
EXPERT	The telephone and cable  companies assured the Commission that they would make commercially-reasonable alternative  facilities available to unaffiliated ISPs.85  The Commission believed them and agreed that ending  Open Access was an acceptable concession for the promised broadband deployment.
EXPERT	However,  the promised investment has not occurred.
EXPERT	The incumbents robustly improved the telecommunications network for decades even  after Open Access principles were first developed in the 1960s.
EXPERT	The Commission embraced  Open Access as a means to facilitate competition in a series of cases related to interconnection,  customer premises equipment, inside wiring and enhanced/information services.
EXPERT	The  incumbents had no real choice but to continue investing, because their profits came from a return  on investment under traditional regulatory principles; if they failed to make new investment they  earned less profit.
EXPERT	In hindsight, the fact that competition didn\u2019t develop in an unregulated environment  should not come as a surprise.

EXPERT	On the other hand,  if that company faces little competition in the wire market, it can earn extraordinary profit from  both wire and adjacent products that use wires by restricting output and keeping the price high.
EXPERT	The rest of the developed world understands this incentive and has maintained Open Access.
EXPERT	Some commentators have observed that domestic capital investment and employment growth  have slowed since the mid-2000s, while overseas investment \u2013 even under Open Access \u2013 has  accelerated, especially when analyzed on a constant-dollar basis86  AT&T and Verizon have  reduced or ended their network extension efforts and essentially yielded to the cable companies  in many areas.
EXPERT	The problem does not reside with those who provide Internet; it arises because  transmission is still a monopoly (or a duopoly).
EXPERT	From a technical and economic perspective,  transmission and Internet access are two separate markets, although they are adjacent.87  Once  again, the Commission recognized this very fact in the Computer Inquiries.
EXPERT	The very purpose of  that proceeding was to isolate monopoly components and impose regulation on monopoly  activity, while deregulating potentially competitive enhanced services.
EXPERT	The broadband service sector could become fully competitive again if the underlying  bottleneck transmission components are available on a common carrier basis to all potential  purchasers.
EXPERT	That is precisely how it worked in the dial-up days and the move to broadband does  not justify a different result.
EXPERT	If we return to Open Access and allow competition back into the  #2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; 86 See, e.g., S. Derek Turner, Fighting the Zombie Lies: Sorry ISPs, Title II Is Good for the Economy, TM +   2009\u20132014 Free Press, available at http://www.freepress.net/blog/2014/05/14/fighting-zombie-lies-sorry-isps-title- ii-good-economy (\u201cInvestment: Under Title II, Bell Company capital investments increased by 20 percent (a CAGR  of 1.8 percent).
EXPERT	But after the Commission removed Title II, capital investment at these companies declined by 5  percent (a CAGR of negative 0.7 percent).
EXPERT	\u2026 Jobs: Bell Company jobs are down 20 percent since the removal of  Title II.
EXPERT	Employment at these companies peaked in 2000 following the period when the Bells were subjected to the  most comprehensive implementation of Title II.\u201d).
EXPERT	87  Internet Access depends on transmission service inputs, but they are logically and practically separate markets.
EXPERT	From an antitrust perspective, the Commission basically allowed the incumbents to engage in monopoly leveraging  and then a tying arrangement.
EXPERT	31  Internet access market, then any Internet access provider that fails to act consistent with  consumer expectations will quickly be faced with alternative providers offering prices and terms  that users really want.88  As it stands, however, the last mile transmission input is available only  to the telephone and cable companies for Internet access.
EXPERT	They therefore can now monopolize  both the transmission and the Internet access.
EXPERT	The Commission had recognized for 40 years that  this kind of vertical integration and leveraging inexorably leads to discrimination and rationing  as a means to keep prices and profits artificially high.
EXPERT	But the rules put in place to prevent these  predictable harms were jettisoned in favor of still-unfulfilled investment promises and  expectations that competition would thrive.
EXPERT	V. TITLE II RECLASSIFICATION WOULD BE BASED ON THE COMMISSION\u2019S  WELL-ESTABLISHED LEGAL AUTHORITY AND WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT  TO REJECTION BY THE COURTS.
EXPERT	The Commission\u2019s decision to classify cable modem service as an information service  was affirmed in Brand X, largely due to Chevron deference.
EXPERT	A decision to reclassify the  transmission component of broadband Internet access \u2013 or broadband Internet access itself \u2013  would again receive Chevron deference from the courts.
EXPERT	The decision could be well-reasoned  and supportable because broadband providers clearly constitute common law common carriers.
EXPERT	But there are lessons to be learned by reviewing the premises and expectations upon which the  classification decision was based.
EXPERT	First, it is noteworthy that the Cable Modem Declaratory Ruling glossed over the fact  that many if not most cable companies have historically provided \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d  #2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; 88 Many of the activities identified as \u201cproblems\u201d in this entire debate would not much of a concern if there was a  competitive market.
EXPERT	A provider\u2019s attempt to impose \u201ccontent value\u201d pricing, or even \u201cdiscrimination\u201d simply would  not succeed if there were alternatives \u2013 unless consumers decided that is what they actually want.
EXPERT	If that is what they  want, then the activity is merely fulfilling consumer desires and that is a good thing.
EXPERT	The problem arises when the  two dominant providers impose these results, despite rather than because of consumer desires.
EXPERT	32  (\u201cbasic service\u201d under Computer Inquiry I), albeit perhaps not for \u201cbroadband Internet access.\u201d89 Several were, in fact, common carriers.
EXPERT	Several also offered \u201ctelecommunications\u201d on a private  carrier basis, including a few that successfully convinced the Commission to preempt state  efforts to impose intrastate common carrier regulation over their \u201ctelecommunications\u201d  offering.90   Cox/CoxDTS and United Cable centered on state commission efforts to regulate cable  company institutional high-speed digital transmission services.
EXPERT	The \u201chigh-speed digital  transmission service\u201d supported enhanced services supplied by \u201cgovernmental and educational  institutions and private businesses.\u201d91  Presumably United Cable\u2019s high-speed digital  transmission service was or could also be used to support enhanced operations as well.
EXPERT	This was \u201ctelecommunications.\u201d  This was \u201cbroadband.\u201d  It was used (at least in part) to  support enhanced functionalities.
EXPERT	In Cox/Cox DTS the Commission chose to not impose  common carriage on Commline\u2019s service.
EXPERT	Cox\u2019s \u201cDTS\u201d service, however, was common carrier  although it enjoyed \u201cforbearance\u201d from tariffing.92  These cases demonstrate that cable  companies have provided broadband transmission \u201ctelecommunications,\u201d some of which was a  \u201ctelecommunications service,\u201d and this transmission product was used to support  enhanced/information services supplied by unaffiliated private and public third parties.
EXPERT	The case  was about \u201cbroadband data services.\u201d93  The Cable Modem Declaratory Ruling overstated one of  its premises by overlooking the fact that cable companies had indeed offered a stand-alone  #2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; 89 See Cable Modem Declaratory Ruling, 17 FCC Rcd at 4824-4826, 4828, PP 42-46, 51.

EXPERT	Further, some of those were used to support enhanced services provided by the subscriber to the  service.
EXPERT	Further, few seem to recall that NARUC II involved two-way non-video cable company  provided transmission service offerings that were ultimately held by the court to be common  carrier.
EXPERT	The Commission had preempted state regulation and refrained from imposing common  carriage.
EXPERT	The NARUC II court reversed, however, and held that the specific offer in issue there  was telecommunications and should have been treated as common carrier because it met all the  relevant indicia of common carriage.94  \u201cThe clear content of that term (common carrier) as  developed at common law and discussed in our previous N.A.R.U.C.
EXPERT	opinion indicates that most  or all of the two-way, non-video cable operations at issue here do fit within the common carrier  concept.
EXPERT	Because at least the bulk of those activities are also clearly intrastate, we cannot avoid  the conclusion that the S 152(b) jurisdictional bar clearly applies, beyond any margin for  deference or discretion.\u201d95   All seem to agree that cable companies\u2019 broadband transmission is telecommunications  and both the Commission and courts have recognized that some of their offerings can be, or are,  common carrier and thus telecommunications service.
EXPERT	The question then becomes whether the  Commission should \u2013 after the experience gained over the last several years \u2013 decide that it will  isolate the transmission portion in issue today and require that it be offered on a common carrier  basis going forward, by declaring that the transmission involved here is and should be a  \u201ctelecommunications service.\u201d  The answer to both parts of this question should be \u201cyes.\u201d  #2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; 94 NARUC II, 533 F.2d at 608-610.

EXPERT	34  Although the Commission decided not to impose or find common carriage in the Cable  Modem Declaratory Ruling, the cable companies\u2019 current offerings of bundled Internet access  most certainly do meet the holding out and indifference prongs.
EXPERT	They have a standard offer and  do not negotiate individual contracts, particularly for residential and small-business customers.
EXPERT	They typically hold out to serve all comers that meet their eligibility criteria.
EXPERT	They do not  generally choose clients on an individual basis or determine in each particular case whether and  on what terms to serve.96  They meet all of the indicia of common carriage under the common  law.
EXPERT	While the Commission has not required common carriage, the cable companies have  exhibited all the classic signs of a voluntary undertaking to be a common carrier.
EXPERT	It is true that NARUC I97 states that the Commission does not have \u201cunfettered discretion\u201d  to \u201cconfer or not confer common carrier status on a given entity, depending upon the regulatory  goals it seeks to achieve\u201d and went on to hold that \u201c[t]he common law definition of common  carrier is sufficiently definite as not to admit of agency discretion in the classification of  operating communications entities.
EXPERT	A particular system is a common carrier by virtue of its  functions, rather than because it is declared to be so.\u201d98  However, if an entity or class of entities  has voluntarily chosen to act like a common carrier, then the Commission can and should  recognize that reality, and proceed accordingly.
EXPERT	\u201cIf practice and experience show the [cable  companies and telephone companies] to be common carriers, then the Commission must  determine its responsibilities from the language of the Title II common carrier provisions.\u201d99   The actual operations of cable and telephone companies\u2019 broadband Internet access services  #2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; 96 Cf.

EXPERT	Title II can and should be applied.
EXPERT	Then the Commission should require unbundling of the  transmission component.
EXPERT	The Commission has the power to require unbundling and a stand-alone common carrier  offer.
EXPERT	The NARUC I court expressly contemplated this result by asking whether \u201cthere will be  any legal compulsion thus to serve indifferently.\u201d102  The court recognized that as a valid  question and engaged in an analysis of whether there was (and thus could be) a compulsion, so  there is room for regulators to compel common carrier classification in appropriate  circumstances, especially when the providers are already acting consistent with that designation  in their actual dealings.
EXPERT	i2Coalition believes that the proper choice is to return to Open Access by using Title II  authority and mandating unbundling of the transmission component.
EXPERT	If this is done, the  Commission does not need to regulate Internet access because competition will sufficiently  constrain the dominant actors.
EXPERT	If, however, the Commission does not return to Open Access,  then it is necessary to regulate broadband Internet access under Title II because the dominant  providers face no competitive constraints.
EXPERT	If the Commission is going to eliminate the Internet  access evils identified in the NPRM through direct regulation, then effective and clear  prohibitions on blocking and unreasonable discrimination are imperative.

EXPERT	MOBILE AND FIXED BROADBAND SERVICE SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO  EQUAL AND CONSISTENT RULES.
EXPERT	The NPRM proposes to maintain the Open Internet Order\u2019s mobile no-blocking rule, and  thus maintain inconsistent requirements for fixed and mobile broadband.
EXPERT	i2Coalition supports  the principle of technology neutral rules and believes that the same no-blocking rule should be  applied in a consistent manner.
EXPERT	Separate rules and standards entrench differences, rather than  encourage convergence and competition.
EXPERT	If wireless broadband is ever to become a viable  alternative to wired broadband, the product should not evolve with different regulatory  expectations that become more ingrained and permanent over time.
EXPERT	Of note, the current and proposed rule for mobile broadband is also far less robust than  the standards imposed for Upper 700 MHz C-Block mobile licensees.
EXPERT	For example, Verizon\u2019s  previous blocking of tethering that led to the settlement described in NPRM at paragraph 41 and  note 93 would not be a violation of the current and proposed mobile no-blocking rule, since it  does not at all address attachment of devices and speaks only to \u201capplications that compete with  the provider\u2019s voice or video telephony services.\u201d103  The NPRM cites other examples of mobile  blocking that were mentioned in Open Internet Order.104  The current and proposed mobile no- blocking rule would likely prohibit the blocking of Skype, because it at least arguably competes  with voice service.
EXPERT	However, it would not ban blocking many alternative online payment  services since they are not always provided via a website (and often involve installing an  #2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; 103 The proposed mobile no-blocking rule would probably outlaw AT&T\u2019s prior actions blocking FaceTime that is  also referenced in NPRM at paragraph 41.

EXPERT	37  application)105 and are not voice or video telephony services.
EXPERT	Similarly, the rule would not ban a  mobile provider from blocking Slingbox106 or peer-to-peer applications.
EXPERT	The Open Internet  Order decided to have a \u201ctargeted prophylactic rule\u201d restricting \u201conly practices that appear to  have an element of anticompetitive intent\u201d and held that restrictions regarding applications that  compete with a mobile providers\u2019 voice or video telephony offerings was \u201cappropriate at this  time\u201d in lieu of a \u201cbroader no-blocking rule.\u201d107  The Commission said it would \u201cmonitor\u201d  developments and reassess should the need arise.108 The Commission should indeed revisit its original decision and apply the same no- blocking rules to both fixed and mobile broadband service.109  Consistency is a far superior  policy.
EXPERT	Any technical differences based on network technology that may justify a different  outcome can be dealt with through the \u201csubject to reasonable network management\u201d exception.
EXPERT	VII.
EXPERT	CASE STUDY: PRIVACY AND ENCRYPTION  A.
EXPERT	Paid prioritization arrangements are a threat to Internet privacy.
EXPERT	The NPRM gives significant consideration to content-based network practices, but never  stops to consider the privacy implications for American Internet users.
EXPERT	The Commission  discusses at great lengths whether paid priority arrangements are consistent with an open Internet  and if they could be implemented on a commercially reasonable basis, yet never seems to realize  that it is contemplating the wholesale monitoring of the content of Americans\u2019 broadband  Internet connections.
EXPERT	#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; 105 Cf.
EXPERT	Open Internet Order, 25 FCC Rcd at 17960 P 100.
EXPERT	106 Slingbox may or may not be a \u201cvideo service\u201d depending on how that is defined, but it is clearly not a \u201cvideo  telephony service\u201d and therefore would be excluded from protection.

EXPERT	at 17962 PP 104-105.
EXPERT	109 NPRM at P 62.
EXPERT	38  However, any arrangement in which a broadband ISP provides priority treatment to an  edge provider necessarily contemplates content monitoring.
EXPERT	For example, should Comcast enter  into paid prioritization deal with Netflix, Comcast will need technological means to identify the  Netflix traffic subject to the arrangement.
EXPERT	This will require that Comcast, at a minimum, monitor  the services, applications, devices, and websites with whom its customers are communicating.
EXPERT	Furthermore, Section 8.9 of the proposed rules officially sanctions copyright enforcement efforts  by broadband Internet access providers.
EXPERT	This would mean that broadband providers now have  the blessing of the Commission to open up their end users\u2019 packets to filter content.
EXPERT	Unless there  is a competitive market where users have choices among multiple broadband Internet access  providers, the Commission should uphold Americans\u2019 privacy rights and be wary of content  inspection-based services.
EXPERT	B.
EXPERT	The proposed rules fail to account for encryption technologies.
EXPERT	Internet users themselves are quite concerned about the privacy of their online  communications.
EXPERT	Virtual private network (VPN) services are thriving.
EXPERT	Other privacy  applications like the TOR browser are becoming increasingly popular.
EXPERT	Edge providers are  providing privacy enhancing options and the use of SSL encryption has become ubiquitous.
EXPERT	It is  generally considered a positive development that American Internet users are becoming more  jealous of their fundamental privacy rights.
EXPERT	The Commission should not adopt policies that  frustrate Americans\u2019 exercise of their civil liberties and should instead encourage such behavior.
EXPERT	This proliferation of encryption-based privacy tools presents significant uncertainty to the  viability of the NPRM\u2019s proposed paid priority regime.
EXPERT	For example, how could Comcast  prioritize Netflix traffic (to use the example above) when an end user utilizes an encrypted VPN  service?
EXPERT	Would that user have to choose between their privacy and their ability to access Netflix   39  as intended?
EXPERT	Would Comcast have the right to decrypt encrypted traffic in order to make  prioritization decisions?
EXPERT	Section 8.9 of the proposed rules permits \u201creasonable\u201d efforts to  address unlawful content.
EXPERT	Does that include decryption to filter for copyrighted content, or even  an outright ban on encryption because it would interfere with efforts to address unlawful  content?
EXPERT	Would encrypted traffic constitute lawful traffic subject to the no-blocking rule even  though encryption is sometimes used to mask unlawful traffic?
EXPERT	The no-blocking rule for mobile  broadband only prevents the blocking of applications with which the wireless carriers compete.
EXPERT	Therefore, can mobile broadband providers block encryption tools that Internet users utilize to  protect their online privacy?
EXPERT	The example of encryption and privacy demonstrate that the market does not neatly fit  into the Commission\u2019s proposed definitions and rules.
EXPERT	Nor do the rules meet users\u2019 desires and  needs.
EXPERT	A paid priority regime assumes that innovation will only occur at the minimum level of  service.
EXPERT	It assumes that all Internet traffic is and will remain transparent to broadband access  providers.
EXPERT	It also ensures that innovation at very high bandwidth levels is only available to  existing, successful edge providers with the means to purchase prioritization.
EXPERT	Fundamentally,  the Commission is attempting to limit the future Internet to the confines of today\u2019s Internet,  which favors the current large market participants over small players.
EXPERT	Innovation and the market  are unpredictable.
EXPERT	The best way to ensure that the Internet remains open well into the future is  by ensuring that competition exists on all parts of the network, especially the presently-closed  last mile transmission component.
EXPERT	VIII.
EXPERT	ANALYSIS OF THE TEXT OF THE PROPOSED RULES  i2Coalition offers the following observations and recommendations on the text of the  proposed rules.
EXPERT	40  A.
EXPERT	Authority for Part 8 Rules  NPRM Appendix A sets out the proposed rules.
EXPERT	The Appendix states that the authority  for the rules is derived from 47 U.S.C.
EXPERT	SS 151, 152, 154(i)-(j), 303, 316 and 1302.
EXPERT	The  Commission should also invoke its Title II authority.
EXPERT	As explained above, i2Coalition does not  believe the Commission should impose common carrier regulation on \u201cInternet access\u201d at this  point and should instead reinstate Open Access so competition can return to the Internet access  market.
EXPERT	Title II is a necessary prerequisite to reinstating Open Access through Computer Inquiry  type rules.
EXPERT	But if the Commission does choose to regulate Internet access and wants rules that  are meaningful and effective to deter the harms identified in the NPRM, then Title II is a  prerequisite as well.
EXPERT	As shown above, the no-blocking and commercially reasonable rules are  per se common carrier obligations.
EXPERT	The Commission should expressly rely on its Title II  authority as the basis for these rules because S 706 (47 U.S.C.
EXPERT	S 1302) on its own does not  provide sufficient authority to promulgate or enforce common carrier rules.
EXPERT	Therefore,  references to SS 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 208, 209, 211, 215, 218, 219, 220, 251 and 252  should be added.
EXPERT	Given that it may be appropriate to forbear from applying some of the above- listed statutory provisions, a reference to S 160 should be added as well.
EXPERT	The following analysis and recommendations on the proposed rules assumes a decision to  regulate Internet access either in addition to or instead of returning to Open Access.
EXPERT	B.   Transparency Rule  The transparency rule should expressly require meaningful and plain-English disclosures  of practices and policies that impact user privacy.
EXPERT	Specifically, i2Coalition recommends that a  new subsection (d) be added to S 8.3 stating as follows:  (d) A person engaged in the provision of broadband Internet access service shall  have a publicly-available privacy policy that meaningfully explains what user   41  information is gathered, how it is gathered, the purposes for which any user  information that is gathered will be used, and to whom user information will be  disclosed and under what circumstances.
EXPERT	The privacy policy must be a part of  any contractual relationship with each user and enforceable as such.
EXPERT	The privacy  policy must state whether the provider employs Deep Packet Inspection and  inspects content, and if so for what purpose(s) Deep Packet Inspection is  employed, and disclose each purpose for which the information collected or  gleaned from collected information is used; the length of time any intercepted  content or derived information is stored; and the specific circumstances under  which any intercepted content or derived information will be disclosed to third  party governmental or private entities.
EXPERT	If a provider does employ Deep Packet  Inspection and retains any user content or information derived from such content,  the privacy policy must expressly provide that the provider does not assert any  ownership or property rights to the content or derived information, and all  property rights remain with the original owner of the content, e.g., the edge  provider or end user.
EXPERT	C. No-Blocking Rule   The simplest way to reinstate a workable no-blocking requirement would be to accept,  indeed embrace, the concept that no blocking is a per se common carrier obligation, and apply  Title II.
EXPERT	The Commission should also eliminate the proposed different treatment between fixed  and mobile broadband.
EXPERT	The Commission should apply one no-blocking standard.
EXPERT	As explained above, the same concerns apply to both fixed and mobile, and the basic rule  should be the same.
EXPERT	Different treatment will invite gaming the definitions by all sides: those that  want the harsher rule to apply will try to argue that the wireless service is fixed, while the  wireless provider will say it is mobile.
EXPERT	The lesser standard will allow wireless broadband providers to block content from  sources other than lawful websites.
EXPERT	The Internet, however, is far more than just a collection of  websites and content can be acquired from or sent to Internet destinations that are not on the  web.
EXPERT	Content is available from and is routinely sent to servers that are not based on HTML.
EXPERT	The  mobile no-blocking obligation should apply to all content.
EXPERT	42   The draft mobile wireless no-blocking rule only prohibits providers from blocking  \u201capplications that compete with the provider\u2019s voice or video telephony services.\u201d It would  therefore allow a mobile provider to block any application that is not voice or video telephony.
EXPERT	If the wireless provider does not offer video telephony, then it could block such applications.
EXPERT	The rule would allow the wireless provider to block email applications or individual emails.
EXPERT	The  rule would allow the wireless provider to block the great preponderance of applications and  services that presently exist.110  The rule would allow wireless providers to block encryption and  virtual private networks, which are useful for privacy-conscious individuals and imperatives for  many businesses and their employees.
EXPERT	D.   \u201cCommercially reasonable\u201d vs. \u201cNo unreasonable discrimination\u201d  The Commission should abandon the pretext of banning unwanted discrimination through  the commercially reasonable rule, expressly invoke Title II and then proceed to ban unreasonable  discrimination.
EXPERT	\u201cUnreasonable discrimination\u201d should be further defined, and broader than the  discrimination rule contained in the now-vacated S 8.7.
EXPERT	The Open Internet Order indicated that  use-agnostic differential treatment would not be unreasonable.111  The original rule prevented  discrimination yielding anti-competitive results, as well as other forms of discrimination not  based on anti-competitive intent, but still deemed harmful to the public interest.112  Nonetheless,  the Commission indicated that some forms of discrimination based on application, content,  services, use, source/destination or device might not be unreasonable.
EXPERT	For example, Open  Internet Order P 71 explained that \u201cpacket prioritization\u201d as part of service to consumers is likely  #2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; 110 If one peruses the app stores for Apple, Google, Microsoft, or any of the others offering mobile apps, it quickly  becomes apparent that voice and video telephony apps are a small minority in comparison to other kinds.
EXPERT	111 Open Internet Order, 25 FCC Rcd at 17946 PP 73 and 75.
EXPERT	Commenters sometimes call for \u201capplication- agnostic\u201d rules, but this characterization is actually a shorthand way of describing concerns over differential  treatment of applications, content, services, use, source/destination or device based on network provider choices  rather than user choice or desire.
EXPERT	112 Open Internet Order, 25 FCC Rcd at 17949 P 78.
EXPERT	43  not unreasonable discrimination.
EXPERT	This could be read to allow prioritization regimes regarding  specific applications, content, services, use, source/destination or devices determined solely by  the network provider and independent of (and perhaps even despite) user desire.
EXPERT	If the Commission decides to continue regulating Internet access, it should invoke Title II  and reinstate the \u201cno unreasonable discrimination\u201d rule.
EXPERT	It should then make clear that  discrimination between or among applications, content, services, use, source/destination or  devices determined solely by the network provider and independent of user desire is  unreasonable discrimination.
EXPERT	The rule should be truly use agnostic \u2013 except where the user requests differential treatment.
EXPERT	E.   Other Laws and Considerations  The Commission proposes to retain S 8.9.  i2Coalition believes that the final sentence  invites and encourages Internet access providers to invasively surveil user activity, or at least  give permission for providers to inspect users\u2019 content.
EXPERT	It therefore implicitly blesses invasions  of privacy.
EXPERT	The entire sentence should be stricken, or clarified in some fashion so it cannot be  used as a defense to or justification for content inspection absent express user consent.
EXPERT	F.   S 8.11 Definitions  1.
EXPERT	Definition of \u201cBlock\u201d (8.11(a))  The proposed definition for \u201cblock\u201d should not exclusively focus on what is being  delivered to the edge provider for purposes of assessing whether a \u201cminimum level of access\u201d is  not being provided and thus there is blocking.
EXPERT	The Commission should be at least equally (if not  exclusively) concerned with whether the end user is receiving an adequate level of access that  allows the end user to simultaneously send information to and receive information from all  desired endpoints, both individually and collectively.
EXPERT	44  The proposed definition should be amended to reinforce that the purpose of the no- blocking obligation: to ensure that users may send or receive desired content and employ the  \u201capplications, services, or non-harmful devices\u201d they choose.
EXPERT	i2Coalition recommends this text for the final definition:  The failure of a broadband Internet access service to provide an edge provider  with a minimum level of access113 that is sufficiently robust, fast, and dynamic for  effective use by end users and edge providers., and allows end users to send or  receive desired content and employ the applications, services, or non-harmful  devices they choose.
EXPERT	2.
EXPERT	Definition of \u201cBroadband Internet access service\u201d (8.11(b))  The Commission proposes to retain the original definition for Broadband Internet Access  Service promulgated in the Open Internet Order.
EXPERT	i2Coalition believes it should be changed.
EXPERT	The present and proposed definition states as follows:  (a) Broadband Internet Access Service.
EXPERT	A mass-market retail service by wire or  radio that provides the capability to transmit data to and receive data from all or  substantially all Internet endpoints, including any capabilities that are incidental  to and enable the operation of the communications service, but excluding dial- up114 Internet access service.
EXPERT	This term also encompasses any service that the  Commission finds to be providing a functional equivalent of the service described  in the previous sentence, or that is used to evade the protections set forth in this  Part.
EXPERT	#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; 113 i2Coalition has significant concerns with the proposal to define a \u201cminimum level of access\u201d in order to then  allow priority services to edge providers that exceed that level.
EXPERT	The avowed purpose is to have a back-door means  to prevent unreasonable discrimination while purporting to satisfy the D.C. Circuit\u2019s reasons for vacating the  discrimination rule.
EXPERT	i2Coalition believes that \u2013 if the Commission decides to regulate Internet access \u2013 the  Commission should instead proceed to invoke Title II and reinstate the no-discrimination rule under that authority.
EXPERT	Thus, we have stricken the reference to minimum level of access in this proposed edit is made in the alternative.
EXPERT	If  the Commission persists in taking the approach proposed in the NPRM then the reference to \u201cminimum level of  access\u201d should be retained.
EXPERT	114 Open Internet Order, 25 FCC Rcd at 17935 P 51.
EXPERT	The Commission excluded \u201cdial-up Internet access service\u201d  because of \u201cthe easy ability to switch among competing dial-up Internet access services.
EXPERT	Moreover, the underlying  dial-up Internet access service is subject to protections under Title II of the Communications Act.
EXPERT	The  Commission\u2019s interpretation of those protections has resulted in a market for dial-up Internet access that does not  present the same concerns as the market for broadband Internet access.\u201d  This is a frank acknowledgement that if the  Commission had not eliminated Open Access for broadband facilities then the concerns driving today\u2019s debate of  \u201cNet Neutrality\u201d would not exist.
EXPERT	If the Commission reinstates Open Access then the underlying concerns will go  away and regulation of Internet access will not be necessary.
EXPERT	45  This definition has not been adequately subjected to critical analysis.
EXPERT	There are some potential  problems and a better definition can be devised.
EXPERT	First, the definition may capture activities beyond merely Internet access.
EXPERT	Open Internet  Order PP 47 and 52 stressed that it was not supposed to include activities that appeared to meet  the definition in whole or in part, such as \u201cvirtual private network services, content delivery  network services, multichannel video programming services, hosting or data storage services, or  Internet backbone services (if those services are separate from broadband Internet access  service)\u201d or \u201ccoffee shops, bookstores, airlines, and other entities when they acquire Internet  service from a broadband provider to enable their patrons to access the Internet from their  establishments.\u201d  That is fine so far as it goes, but the list is not exhaustive.
EXPERT	There are other  activities that are not listed and meet the definition.
EXPERT	For example, an open proxy server that  facilitates requests using all protocols and extending to \u201csubstantially all Internet endpoints\u201d  would meet the definition.115    Second, the definition does not focus on the transmission component, and that is one of  the reasons the definition may be stretched past its intended limitations.
EXPERT	The primary  differentiating quality of the activity sought to be regulated (broadband Internet access) and other  activities that need not be regulated and should not be regulated is the broadband transmission  link between the provider and end user.
EXPERT	Without this link there is no access.
EXPERT	Other activities that  are not intended to be covered (like the proxy server example above) do not come with  transmission.
EXPERT	While this point is illustrated by the focus on transmission type in the definitions  for fixed and mobile, i2Coalition has recommended that the two types be treated the same, and  have the same text.
EXPERT	Any justifiable differential treatment based on network technologies used for  #2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; 115 TOR proxies, for example, support more than just web requests, and provide connectivity to virtually the entire  Internet.
EXPERT	46  the transmission portion should be resolved through the reasonable network management  exception.
EXPERT	But even if the differential treatment is maintained the main definition should also  include transmission as a distinguishing and qualifying characteristic.
EXPERT	A preferable definition can be pulled from S 706.
EXPERT	The Commission maintains that S 706  is an important source of authority for the contemplated rules.
EXPERT	While i2Coalition does not  believe S 706 is sufficient, it is relevant.
EXPERT	The alternative definition supplied below draws heavily  from S 706, and then adds some of the components in the existing rule.
EXPERT	(a) Broadband Internet Access Service.
EXPERT	A mass-market retail service, without  regard to any transmission media or technology, that provides high-speed,  switched, broadband telecommunications capability and allows the retail user  purchasing broadband telecommunications links and any bundled or ancillary  functionalities to (1) originate and receive high-quality voice, data, graphics,  video and other information content of the user\u2019s choosing, (2) obtain  applications, services and content from one or more Edge Providers, and/or (3)  communicate with other end users or endpoints on the Internet.
EXPERT	This term also  encompasses any service that the Commission finds to be providing a functional  equivalent of the service described in the previous sentence, or that is used to  evade the protections set forth in this Part.
EXPERT	3.
EXPERT	Definition of \u201cEdge Provider\u201d (8.11(c))     This proposed definition uses other terms of art that are not themselves defined in the  proposed rules.
EXPERT	i2Coalition believes that definitions for \u201capplication\u201d and \u201ccontent\u201d are also  needed.
EXPERT	Proposed definitions for these terms are supplied below.

EXPERT	Definition of \u201cFixed broadband Internet access service\u201d (8.11(e))     The terminology used in this rule (and the one for mobile) could lead to disputes over  whether a given service is mobile or fixed wireless broadband.
EXPERT	If the no-blocking differences are  maintained, then given the material regulatory differences under the proposed rules between a  fixed wireless service and mobile service, providers will be much incented to call the service  mobile but others will want to label it fixed.
EXPERT	Since there may be different reasonable network   47  management outcomes depending on whether a service is mobile or fixed the terms do need to be  defined.
EXPERT	The final rules must be clear, which the current proposed rules are not.
EXPERT	Assume that a wireless user has a 4G capable router (with or without an externally- mounted antenna) that distributes the signal to desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones using  Wi-Fi.
EXPERT	The router can in fact operate while in motion, assuming it is powered from some form  of battery.
EXPERT	But even if the router is stationary several of the other devices (laptop, tablet,  smartphone) that connect to it are not.
EXPERT	Does this type of arrangement serve end users primarily  at fixed endpoints using stationary equipment?
EXPERT	If the router is the endpoint then the answer is  yes.
EXPERT	If the other devices are the endpoints that matter, then the answer is no.
EXPERT	Second, a mobile station can be \u201cstationary\u201d at certain times, or even most of the time  and still be a mobile station.
EXPERT	In one case before the Commission, complaining parties claimed  that a wireless device and associated service was fixed based on the size and the difficulty  associated with moving it about, as well as the fact that it tended to be stationary most of the  time.
EXPERT	A \u201claptop-sized wireless access unit\u201d powered from an electrical outlet or by battery that  was \u201capproximately 2.76 inches x 12.9 inches x 11.8 inches and weigh[ed] 8.3 pounds including  the built-in battery\u201d that came with a short antenna and \u201ca larger high gain antenna for exterior  mounting\u201d was found to be a mobile station because it could move, could operate while in  motion, and had been operated while in motion in some instances.116   i2Coalition recommends that the final rule delete \u201cusing stationary equipment.\u201d  There  does not appear to be much caselaw on what stationary would mean.
EXPERT	The definition for \u201cfixed  #2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; 116 In the Matter of Petition of the State Independent Alliance and the Independent Telecommunications Group for a  Declaratory Ruling that the Basic Universal Service Offering Provided by Western Wireless in Kansas is Subject to  Regulation as Local Exchange Service, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 17 FCC Rcd 14802 (2002), vacated,  dismissed as moot, Order on Reconsideration, 22 FCC Rcd 12015 (2007).
EXPERT	48  station\u201d at 47 C.F.R.
EXPERT	S 1.907 is clearer.117  The Commission has far more experience with  applying this definition in specific contexts.
EXPERT	Then the Commission should make clear that the  station under inquiry is the one that makes the direct connection to the wireless network, and  authenticates on that network, rather than other devices that receive information via the station\u2019s  router capabilities.
EXPERT	5.
EXPERT	Definition of \u201cMobile broadband Internet access service\u201d (8.11(f))     The reference to \u201cmobile stations\u201d as the qualifier for what is a \u201cMobile broadband  Internet access service\u201d can also lead to disputes over whether a given service that relies on  spectrum for transport is mobile or fixed.
EXPERT	The Act and Commission rules have several different definitions and they are not all the  same.
EXPERT	The Act (S 153(34)) defines a mobile station as \u201ca radio-communication station capable  of being moved and which ordinarily does move.\u201d  The definition for \u201cmobile station\u201d in 47  C.F.R.
EXPERT	S 1.907 exactly matches the statutory definition.
EXPERT	On the other hand, 47 C.F.R.
EXPERT	SS 22.99118 and 27.4119 employ slightly different definitions.
EXPERT	The Commission should specify one definition  that will apply.
EXPERT	i2Coalition recommends that the statutory definition, and therefore also the one  at S 1.907, be used.
EXPERT	This will not fully flesh out potential disputes, but it will at least eliminate  arguments over which definition applies.
EXPERT	6.
EXPERT	Additional Definitions   As noted above, i2Coalition believes that certain terms used in the proposed rules but do  not have definitions should be defined as part of the final rules.
EXPERT	Suggested definitions for those  terms are:  #2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2;#2; 117 \u201cFixed station.
EXPERT	A station operating at a fixed location.\u201d  118 \u201cOne or more transmitters that are capable of operation while in motion.\u201d  119 \u201cA station in the mobile service intended to be used while in motion or during halts at unspecified points.\u201d   49  Application.

EXPERT	CONCLUSION  The discriminatory practices that the Commission is attempting to address in this  proceeding are the direct result of the absence of competition in the broadband market.
EXPERT	The  proposed rules would regulate Internet access providers\u2019 actions, but would not address the root  problem.
EXPERT	Only Open Access would allow competition and consumer choice back into the  broadband access market.
EXPERT	i2Coalition recommends that the Commission return to the Open  Access policies that first brought us the open Internet by reclassifying the broadband  transmission component as a telecommunications service under Title II.

EXPERT	I am a small business person.
EXPERT	I have no employees other than myself.
EXPERT	I rely heavily on the  Internet to be able to do research for clients, and to communicate with them.
EXPERT	The fact that you  are even CONSIDERING allowing large corporate providers of internet services to be treated  differently from other common carriers is appalling to me.
EXPERT	Internet providers are common  carriers just like the trains are or trucking companies, or phone companies, or other industries.
EXPERT	Just because what they are carrying can\u2019t be seen by the naked eye, because it is in the form of  electrons, and bits \u2013 doesn\u2019t make them any less a common carrier.
EXPERT	They should not be able to  treat customers differently.
EXPERT	Please keep net neutrality.
EXPERT	It is important to most actual users of the Internet.
EXPERT	Do not give just  those few big corporations even more power than they already have.
EXPERT	Dear FCC,    My name is Drew Foulkes and I live in Philadelphia, PA.  To me net neutrality, the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) treat all data   that travels over their networks equally, is one the most fundamental free speech issue  of our time.
EXPERT	The internet has revolutionized the way that human beings have been able  to communicate, share-ideas, innovate, teach, learn, debate, instigate, investigate, and  live.
EXPERT	It has cultivated the next generation of entrepreneurs tackling the issues facing  humanity.
EXPERT	It has allowed for individuals from all sides of the planet regardless of skin- color, ethnicity, background, socio-economic status, gender and age to have a seat at  the table of a global conversation.
EXPERT	A conversation previously unthinkable and  unimaginable, and one that will ultimately allow us to find a better future through  collaboration and innovation.
EXPERT	By allowing the tiering of internet bandwidth based off of a company\u2019s economic means  you skew the equal playing field that the internet provides to the citizens of humanity.
EXPERT	Without succumbing to an Orwellian rants the potential of a tiered internet mirrors the  ideology of his seminal work \u201cAnimal Farm,\u201d where \u201call animals are equal, though some  animals are more equal than others.\u201d  I implore you, if we care about our future we need  to continue to bolster a culture of innovation where every member has the opportunity to  play on the same level as everyone else regardless of capital.
EXPERT	You should not need to  be a multi-billion dollar corporation to have access to propagate an idea that may save  us, and ideas do not need to be proprietary.
EXPERT	Please, understand the impact a tiered internet will have on our culture and our  collective future.
EXPERT	Understand the promise of the internet and how some things are just  too important to be advantaged by the upper economic echelons.
EXPERT	Thank you.
EXPERT	I trust you will make a decision that will benefit our nation, our society, and  our world as a whole.
EXPERT	To Chairman Tom Wheeler and the FCC Commissioners\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013      To Chairman Tom Wheeler--      I urge you to schedule large, open public field hearings on net neutrality before   September.
EXPERT	The future of the open internet is too important to be decided without such hearings.
EXPERT	Please support real net neutrality that bans pay lanes and classifies the internet as   a public utility.
EXPERT	Any limitations will hinder mankind from progress in innovation of real solutions to many world  problems.
EXPERT	Merci beaucoup,     Gregory Guerrier

EXPERT	14-28  Protecting and Promoting     )  the Open Internet      )    COMMENTS OF WILLIAMSON & WILLIAMS, PLLC    This comment is primarily adopted from and concurs in part with the comment of the Center for Democracy and  Technology filed at this docket on March 24, 2014, with one exception, which is that we strongly urged the  Commission to revisit the regulatory classification of broadband Internet access services and reclassify  the same as a telecommunications service, which it clearly is, as set forth hereinbelow.
EXPERT	This comment also relies upon CDT\u2019s extensive historical and legal research.
EXPERT	We join CDT in commending the  Commission for its continued focus on the important issue of Internet openness.
EXPERT	These brief comments stress  four basic points:    \u2022  the Commission\u2019s approach to its authority over broadband Internet access is closely related to other  priorities;  \u2022  action to protect the open Internet is needed now;  \u2022  nondiscrimination is an essential element of such protection; and  \u2022  the Commission should expressly disclaim authority over Internet content and over-the-top services.
EXPERT	1.
EXPERT	The Commission\u2019s approach to its authority over broadband Internet access is crucial not just for  this proceeding, but also for the IP transition and the future relevance of the agency.
EXPERT	The proper scope and source of the Commission\u2019s authority over broadband Internet access service is important  not just for the specific subject matter addressed in the Open Internet Order, but also more broadly for the IP  transition and the ongoing role of the Commission in the modern communications environment.
EXPERT	The  Commission should consider the legal authority issue from this broad perspective.
EXPERT	With that in mind, it is perfectly appropriate for the Commission to explore the relatively narrow question of  whether and to what extent it might be able to rely on Section 706 to establish some constraints on online  blocking or discrimination in local Internet access networks.
EXPERT	But the Commission should also recognize that this  issue is best analyzed with an eye to the bigger challenge the agency faces: establishing a clear and stable  conception of the agency\u2019s authority over what is rapidly becoming the core communications network for the  21st century and beyond.
EXPERT	The CDT\u2019s comment points out that the Commission\u2019s National Broadband Plan recognized we were in the  midst of a \u201ctransition from a circuit-switched network to a world in which the broadband Internet serves as \u201ca  platform over which multiple IP-based services \u2013 including voice, data, and video \u2013 converge,\u201d1 and that  promoting the transition to an all-IP network is now a significant Commission priority.2      We would argue that that transition has already taken place for all practical purposes.
EXPERT	The vast majority  of my non-confidential communications with clients take place by cell phone, text and email.
EXPERT	Until  recently, I did not text messaging to communicate with clients because it generated no written record of  such communication.
EXPERT	Now I have cheap software allowing me to dump my phone and preserve test  messages as well as voice messages.
EXPERT	Many of my individual clients do not even have home landlines,  including almost all of my clients under forty, and if they do have landlines, they are primarily internet-  #5;#1;#3;#2;#1;#8;#1; based, rather than traditional switched-based networks.
EXPERT	My nineteen-year old daughter communicates  almost exclusively with her friends via Facebook and other social media and text, rather than by  telephone or even cell phone.
EXPERT	Most people and businesses of whom and which I am aware conduct the  vast majority of their routine business such as banking, shopping, and research online.
EXPERT	My daughter  takes all her news and watches movies by streaming them to her computer.
EXPERT	The vast majority of the  population who do not stream content to our computers take our news and entertainment from cable  television delivered by Comcast, Verizon, or Time-Warner.
EXPERT	Accordingly, we strongly urged the Commission to revisit the regulatory classification of broadband  Internet access services and reclassify the same as a telecommunications service, which it clearly is.
EXPERT	The legal authority questions in this docket cannot reasonably be considered in isolation.
EXPERT	At a minimum, while  an NPRM may well pose some specific and limited questions about the reach of the agency\u2019s authority under  section 706, it should be framed in a manner to encourage input on the full range of considerations and options.
EXPERT	.
EXPERT	Given the foundational importance of the legal basis for Commission authority over broadband Internet access  services, the Commission also needs to think seriously about the interrelations between this docket, the IP  transition, and the docket on Framework for Broadband Internet Service (GN Docket No.
EXPERT	10-127).
EXPERT	Whether the  Commission formally links these dockets or not, they raise a crosscutting issue that requires a consistent  approach.
EXPERT	In this environment, a stable understanding of the Commission\u2019s legal jurisdiction over broadband Internet  access services is essential.
EXPERT	It is hard to see how the Commission can pursue its mission of encouraging \u201crapid,  efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service\u201d3 amidst general uncertainty  regarding its authority over the principal element of the emerging communications landscape.
EXPERT	It is far from clear that section 706 can provide an appropriate general legal foundation for Commission  authority in an Internet-based world.
EXPERT	As the court in FCC v. Verizon observed, section 706 authorizes only those  actions aimed at spurring broadband deployment (and in the case of 706(b), only actions preceded by a finding  that advanced telecommunications are not being deployed to all Americans on a timely basis).
EXPERT	It would be an  odd result indeed if these parameters were to become the new legal touchstones for the bulk of the  Commission\u2019s work (other than spectrum allocation).
EXPERT	It would also make Commission decisions vulnerable to  legal challenges second-guessing the sufficiency of the link between Commission actions and promoting  broadband deployment.
EXPERT	We share CDT\u2019s view that the Commission\u2019s authority over Internet matters should be subject to significant  limits, as we have described in prior comments.4  Maximally expansive authority should not be the goal.
EXPERT	But  appropriately scoped Commission authority is a prerequisite for the Commission pursue any kind of coherent  policy agenda, including the \u201cNetwork Compact\u201d vision outlined in recent months by Chairman Wheeler.5    ____________________________________________  1  Federal Communications Commission, Connecting America: The National Broadband Plan at 59 (Mar.

EXPERT	#6;#1;#3;#2;#1;#8;#1; 2.
EXPERT	The Commission should act to protect Internet openness now \u2013 not wait until non-open practices  have become widespread and entrenched.
EXPERT	The Commission is right to pursue open Internet protections now.
EXPERT	Opponents of regulatory action in this area  often assert that there have been relatively few examples of broadband providers interfering with Internet traffic.
EXPERT	But setting aside the question of how many examples would be enough to warrant action, it is important to  recognize that for virtually the entire history of this policy debate, regulatory policies and ongoing regulatory  proceedings have served as significant constraints on any potential discriminatory behavior by carriers.
EXPERT	Consider  the following timeline:    \u2022 Prior to the 2005 Brand X decision and the FCC decision regarding the legal treatment of DSL services  later that same year, broadband services were potentially subject to common carriage obligations.
EXPERT	\u2022  In 2005, the Commission\u2019s broadband Policy Statement put broadband providers on notice that  interfering with the transmission of lawful online content or services could draw substantial regulatory  scrutiny.
EXPERT	\u2022 In 2008, the Commission issued an order reprimanding Comcast for interfering   with some of its  subscribers\u2019 BitTorrent uploads, thus confirming the Commission\u2019s intent to police broadband provider  interference with lawful Internet traffic.
EXPERT	\u2022 The Commission\u2019s action against Comcast was eventually vacated by the D.C.
EXPERT	Circuit in Comcast Corp.  v. FCC.
EXPERT	But by that time, the Commission had already launched in 2009 a rulemaking proceeding to  adopt open Internet protections.
EXPERT	Broadband providers would have been well aware that any blocking or  discrimination during the pendency of this proceeding would have risked a serious policy backlash and  undermined their arguments against adopting rules.
EXPERT	\u2022 The Commission adopted the Open Internet Rules in December 2010.
EXPERT	They were not invalidated until  January of 2014.
EXPERT	If the Commission were to let this matter drop in the wake of Verizon v. FCC, we  would be in uncharted territory.
EXPERT	For the first time, there would be neither an existing policy constraining  blocking and discrimination by broadband providers nor a live proceeding aimed at developing such a  policy.
EXPERT	Broadband providers would have unprecedented leeway, with little fear of legal or regulatory  repercussions, to try to exercise new measures of influence or control over the content, applications, and  services employed by their subscribers.
EXPERT	The Commission is right to preempt such a dangerous  experiment.
EXPERT	If practices to favor or disfavor particular Internet traffic were to become widespread, the  damage to Internet openness could prove difficult or impossible to reverse.
EXPERT	Unraveling a web of  discriminatory deals after significant investments have been made, business plans have been built, and  technologies have been deployed would be a difficult and complicated undertaking both logistically and  politically.
EXPERT	Documenting the harms could prove impracticable; nobody knows about small businesses  and innovative applications that are lost before they make it off the ground.
EXPERT	Moreover, it is a safe bet  that any future Commission action to roll back perceived harms after they have occurred would meet  loud complaints about the unjust nature of ex post facto regulatory action.
EXPERT	Broadband providers would  surely say that it is unfair and perhaps illegal for the Commission to interfere with their investment- backed expectations premised on the current legal environment.
EXPERT	Therefore, if we want broadband Internet access services to operate in a manner that preserves the Internet\u2019s  open character, the most efficient, effective, and fair approach is to establish that expectation in advance.
EXPERT	The  Commission should address Internet openness in a proactive manner now, rather than kicking the can down the  road.
EXPERT	3.
EXPERT	Nondiscrimination is an essential part of a robust open Internet rule.
EXPERT	A nondiscrimination principle is an essential component of a framework to protect the Internet\u2019s open nature.
EXPERT	#7;#1;#3;#2;#1;#8;#1; The Commission could not credibly claim to be fulfilling the goals of the Open Internet Order if it adopted an  approach that addressed blocking alone.
EXPERT	An unconstrained right to discriminate would enable broadband providers to exercise almost as much  gatekeeping power as an unconstrained right to block.
EXPERT	By degrading some traffic or prioritizing other traffic,  broadband providers could effectively play favorites in the online marketplace, distorting competition among  online content and applications.
EXPERT	Innovators and upstarts would need to start worrying about what treatment their  traffic will receive from the broadband providers serving their potential end users.
EXPERT	The more favoritism became  widespread, the more innovators would need to consider striking deals with broadband providers to avoid being  placed at a significant performance disadvantage relative to their competitors.
EXPERT	This dynamic is possible even if  outright blocking is prohibited; it would be cold comfort to know that broadband providers cannot entirely  refuse to deliver one\u2019s traffic, if the rules permit them to deliver it at a small fraction of the speed of key rivals.
EXPERT	Discrimination enables scenarios in which the approval and cooperation of large broadband providers becomes a  practical necessity for successful participation in the marketplace for online services.
EXPERT	That is the opposite of  \u201cinnovation without permission,\u201d and it would mean substantially higher entry barriers for online innovation \u2013  in other words, a less open Internet.
EXPERT	As the Commission assesses its potential legal and policy options in this proceeding, it should reject any  approach that would fail to include a nondiscrimination principle.
EXPERT	Nondiscrimination is the core of a  meaningful open Internet safeguard.
EXPERT	4.
EXPERT	The Commission should indicate clearly, from the beginning of this proceeding, that it will not  seek to exert jurisdiction over over-the-top online services.
EXPERT	As CDT argued in earlier proceedings concerning the Open Internet Rules, the Commission should narrowly  focus its regulatory activity on broadband Internet access service \u2013 the physical provision of the transmission  links that connect subscribers to the Internet.
EXPERT	The Commission should expressly disclaim authority over the  content, applications, and services that run over the Internet.6    From a political and public messaging perspective, a clear statement from the Commission that it cannot and  will not pursue higher-layer content regulation would offer the best defense against the all-too-common  rhetorical charge that the Commission aims to \u201cregulate the Internet.\u201d In the absence of language expressly  establishing limits, opponents of Commission action will continue to argue that the effort to preserve the open  Internet may be just the first step in an FCC effort to extend its reach over more and more Internet activity.
EXPERT	The  Commission can best demonstrate that it harbors no such intent by specifically disclaiming any authority over  the myriad applications and content provided over the Internet.
EXPERT	Fencing off online content, applications, and services from FCC oversight is also the best approach from a  policy perspective.
EXPERT	Without clear limits, open-ended theories and applications of jurisdiction could open the  door for future Commissions, pursuing any number of potential policy concerns, to attempt to regulate virtually  any of the wide range of conduct and communications traversing the Internet.
EXPERT	Such a result would undermine  Internet openness and thus contravene the policy goals of this proceeding.
EXPERT	It also would raise significant legal  questions; communication between Internet endpoints is protected speech and cannot generally be regulated, and  courts have repeatedly struck down efforts to regulate Internet content.7        _______________________________________  6  See supra note 4.

EXPERT	To safeguard an open and vibrant  Internet, the Commission should seek to ensure that its approach to this proceeding, far from laying the  groundwork for broader Internet regulation in the future, actually serves as a bulwark against it.
EXPERT	With that in  mind, the Commission should state clearly, from the beginning of this proceeding, that whatever authority it  asserts does not extend to the myriad over-the-top services that the Internet enables.

EXPERT	Box 620308  Littleton, CO 80162  (303) 948-2200  Its Attorney  July 15, 2014   i    Summary  VoIP services are supplanting traditional wireline telephone services, and the public  Internet is replacing the Public Switched Telephone Network.
EXPERT	9-1-1 and Emergency Notification  Services developed in the context of wireline telephony face challenges in accommodating VoIP  telephony.
EXPERT	Difficulties in enforcing collection and remittance of 9-1-1 surcharges, fees and taxes can  best be addressed by assessing the fees on the underlying broadband service.
EXPERT	9-1-1 and Emergency Notification Services are dependent upon accurate caller locations.
EXPERT	The manual location solution developed by the Commission for VoIP 9-1-1 calls should be  replaced by automated solutions.
EXPERT	VoIP providers must also obtain and provide Public Safety  Answering Points (\u201cPSAPs\u201d) with customer addresses and associated VoIP numbers for  Emergency Notification Services, and to assist First Responders in locating customers in the case  of emergencies they report to friends or family rather than 9-1-1.
EXPERT	VoIP providers must also  provide PSAPs with contact information, so that PSAPs can contact the provider when additional  assistance is required.
EXPERT	Finally, with respect to location, solutions for nomadic VoIP services,  including VoIP service over wireless data plans must be developed.
EXPERT	With the development of text-to-911 service and IP-enabled PSAPs, \u201capps\u201d are being  developed to monitor premises or health conditions, capture various types of data, and manually  or automatically transmit it to PSAPs; often without knowledge or approval of PSAPs.
EXPERT	These  apps have the potential to overwhelm PSAPs with false alarms, data which the PSAPs cannot  interpret or is irrelevant to Emergency Response, and data formatted in so manner different ways  that PSAP calltakers cannot possibly decipher the relevant information.
EXPERT	App developers must  comply with data conventions developed by a public safety standards setting organization(s).
EXPERT	ii    Broadband and Internet traffic regulation mechanisms have the potential to prevent users  from calling 9-1-1 on VoIP services, or through other services, when they are needed.
EXPERT	The  Commission must consider impact of its Open Internet Regulations on 9-1-1 service.
EXPERT	The  Commission must adopt a regulatory classification for the Internet and broadband access, and  rules, which assure 9-1-1 service continues to be reliable, efficient and cost-effective.

EXPERT	14-28          To: The Commission  COMMENTS OF  THE BOULDER REGIONAL EMERGENCY TELEPHONE SERVICE AUTHORITY   The Boulder Emergency Telephone Service Authority (\u201cBRETSA\u201d), by its attorney,  hereby submits it\u2019s Comments on the Commission\u2019s May 15, 2014 Notice of Proposed  Rulemaking in the above-referenced Docket (\u201cNPRM\u201d).
EXPERT	BRETSA is a Colorado 9-1-1 Authority which establishes, collects and distributes the  Colorado Emergency Telephone Surcharge to fund 9-1-1 Service in Boulder County, Colorado.
EXPERT	The BRETSA Board includes the Boulder County Sheriff, the City of Boulder Police Chief,  representatives of the Boulder County Firefighters Association and the City of Longmont  Division of Public Safety.
EXPERT	The fifth seat of the Board is filled by representatives of the smaller  cities and towns in Boulder County, Colorado on a rotating basis.
EXPERT	These Comments are thus  intended to represent the perspective of the entity responsible for funding 9-1-1 operations, and  of the agencies and authorities responsible for PSAP operations and overall public safety  services.
EXPERT	As VoIP services supplant traditional telephone services, the public Internet replaces the  Public Switched Telephone Network (\u201cPSTN\u201d), and new Internet-based communications   2  applications are developed and used by the public; new opportunities and challenges will be  provided for 9-1-1 Service, Emergency Notification Services, and First Responders.
EXPERT	BRETSA  believes that a minimum regulatory framework is essential to assure that providers contribute to  established 9-1-1 funding mechanisms and cooperate with established and evolving public safety  systems, procedures and practices to enhance public safety rather than diminish it.
EXPERT	I.
EXPERT	Introduction: Open Internet And 9-1-1.
EXPERT	From its perspective as a Colorado 9-1-1 Authority, BRETSA has seen rapid change in  telecommunications technologies, providers and markets over the past decade.
EXPERT	CenturyLink,  successor in interest to the former RBOC US West/Qwest, now reports that it serves only  twenty-five percent of Colorado homes its facilities pass.
EXPERT	The largest telephone service  providers, by remittance of Emergency Telephone Surcharges and thus customers, are wireless  providers; and over seventy percent of 9-1-1 calls are made from wireless phones.
EXPERT	VoIP  telephone service also represents an increasing percentage of telephone services; though 9-1-1  Authorities and Public Safety Answering Points (\u201cPSAPs\u201d) are not even aware of the full  number or identity of VoIP providers supplying service within their jurisdiction, or whether they  are remitting Emergency Telephone Surcharges which fund 9-1-1 Service.
EXPERT	BRETSA is certain  that there are free riders on the 9-1-1 System who subscribe to telephone services (or equipment  or software to make VoIP calls) but do not contribute to the maintenance of the 9-1-1 System  through payment of Emergency Telephone Surcharges (or 9-1-1 fees or taxes which may be  levied in other states).1                                                    1 VoIP is not the sole culprit.
EXPERT	Point-of-Sale collection of 9-1-1 fees from prepaid wireless users is also inefficient  and inconsistent.
EXPERT	BRETSA has stated in other proceedings that the state-by-state collection of prepaid wireless 9-1-1  fees should be replaced with a nationwide system administered by the FCC, in which a fee is assessed on all  purchased increments of minutes of use.
EXPERT	When the end-user activates the minutes, the prepaid wireless service  provider would require the end-users to provide their residential zip codes, and if they reside in a state which  distributes surcharges to Counties or Cities, to provide their County or City.
EXPERT	The prepaid service provider, rather   3  In addition to issues pertaining to collection and remittance of 9-1-1 surcharges, issues  are presented pertaining to identification of caller location for Emergency Response, caller  locations for purposes of Emergency Notification Services, general customer location  information, VoIP over wireless and nomadic VoIP, and marketing and distribution of Internet  Applications purporting to improve public safety but without coordination with public safety  agencies.
EXPERT	II.
EXPERT	Broadband Providers, Rather Than VoIP Providers, Should Collect And Remit  9-1-1 Surcharges, Fees Or Taxes.
EXPERT	The 9-1-1 System allows the dialing of a single three-digit code anywhere in the country  to reach the local Public Safety Answering point with the authority and capability to dispatch  First Responders to the Caller\u2019s location.
EXPERT	This requires that the 9-1-1 System identify the  location of the caller, determine the PSAP which can dispatch First Responders to the caller\u2019s  location, and route the call to that PSAP all within the set-up time of a voice call to any 10-digit  telephone number.
EXPERT	There is a cost to the technology necessary to accomplish this, and most if not  all states have adopted 9-1-1 Surcharges, Fees or Taxes (\u201c9-1-1 Fees\u201d) as a means of funding the  9-1-1 System.
EXPERT	With facilities-based providers such as LECs, wireless providers and facilities-based  VoIP providers (DSL or cable-based broadband providers who provide broadband service and  also offer VoIP services, for example), local and state authorities know that providers have  facilities and are doing business in the jurisdiction and state.
EXPERT	These authorities are thus able to                                                                                                                                                                than the retail vendor of the prepaid minutes cards, then would then remit the 9-1-1 fee to the appropriate  jurisdiction.
EXPERT	Prepaid fees might also be distributed based on usage statistics, or public policy objectives such as  subsidization of 9-1-1 service in sparsely populated areas might be addressed.
EXPERT	These matters are not at issue in this  proceeding, however.
EXPERT	4  apply and enforce statutory or regulatory requirements for collection and remittance of 9-1-1  Fees.
EXPERT	Where a provider of VoIP services does not have physical facilities in a state and  provides only a device or software for originating and/or terminating calls over the Internet, local  and state authorities often do not know that they are providing service in the state, let alone have  the practical ability to collect 9-1-1 Fees.
EXPERT	In addition, a VoIP provider may have a relatively  small number of providers in any jurisdiction, so that the cost of enforcing the 9-1-1 Fee statutes  or regulations would far exceed the amount of fees involved.
EXPERT	The net effect of migration of users  to various VoIP providers, however, can be significant as well as being inequitable to the VoIP  users\u2019 neighbors who wind up paying for VoIP users\u2019 share of the cost of 9-1-1 Service.
EXPERT	BRETSA believes the best solution is to assess 9-1-1 Fees on the providers of the  broadband connection on which VoIP services operate, per unit of upstream bandwidth.
EXPERT	This  per-connection model for collection and remittance of 9-1-1 Fees is appropriate because, just as  wireless device users can make voice calls or send text messages (and eventually other message  formats) to 9-1-1 but pay a single fee per wireless access (per \u201cline\u201d), broadband users also have  the capability to place calls to 9-1-1 using multiple VoIP providers, and eventually other  applications including multi-media.
EXPERT	Rather than a separate 9-1-1 fee being assessed for  communications services or applications they may use to contact 9-1-1, broadband subscribers  would instead pay a single fee based upon the broadband connection.
EXPERT	The solution is practical,  enforceable, and avoids any potential issue of whether a particular service originating or  terminating voice, text or multimedia messages over the Internet is a communications or an  information service.
EXPERT	5  Assessment of 9-1-1 Fees on broadband service based upon upstream bandwidth  accomplishes two goals.
EXPERT	First, it avoids assessment of a fee on consumers who subscribe only to  a cable television or similar service which involves only delivery of programming or information  to the customer.
EXPERT	Second, it assures that businesses operating VoIP PBXs using broadband  connections, and users capable of simultaneously deriving multiple \u201cPSTN-Quality\u201d VoIP  connections from their broadband service, contribute equitably to the operation of the 9-1-1  System.
EXPERT	State statutes and regulations currently require that service providers collect and remit  9-1-1 Fees from wireline, wireless and VoIP services; and there is uncertainty about the ability to  assess such fees on underlying broadband connections.
EXPERT	The Commission should adopt rules  expressly clarifying that state and local authorities can assess 9-1-1 Fees on VoIP services or  (wireless or wired) broadband connections, but not both.
EXPERT	The Commission should also specify  the minimum unit of upstream bandwidth on which a separate 9-1-1 Fee could be assessed.
EXPERT	The  regulatory status and regime adopted or applied to broadband services must allow authorities to  require broadband providers to collect and remit 9-1-1 Fees.2  III.
EXPERT	Improved Methods Must Be Developed For Providing VoIP Caller Location  Information For 9-1-1 Call Routing And Emergency Response.
EXPERT	Because VoIP service can be provisioned separately from the underlying broadband  connection, service providers do not necessarily know the location at which a VoIP service is  provided.
EXPERT	Some VoIP services can even be relocated and operate over any available broadband  connection at any location.
EXPERT	Only VoIP providers who are also the provider of the underlying                                                    2 BRETSA believes that facilities-based VoIP providers reliably collect and remit 9-1-1 Fees, but that many VoIP  providers whose services are provisioned on broadband facilities provided by other entities (\u201cnon-facilities-based  VoIP providers\u201d) do not reliably collect and remit 9-1-1 Fees.
EXPERT	Assessing 9-1-1 Fees on the underlying broadband  connection will allow facilities-based and non-facilities-based providers to compete on a level playing field in their  provision of communications services which operate over the broadband facilities.
EXPERT	6  broadband service generally associate a service address with a particular VoIP service in their  records.
EXPERT	A common misunderstanding is that caller location information for 9-1-1 calls (\u201cE9-1-1\u201d)  is only necessary when the person who calls 9-1-1 is unable to provide his or her address or  location, either because they are unable to speak or do not know where they are.
EXPERT	However the  location of the caller (the device the caller is using to contact 9-1-1) is required to determine the  PSAP to which the call should be routed.
EXPERT	PSAPs serving jurisdictions (cities or counties) other  than that in which the caller is located do not have the authority, radio frequencies or information  necessary to dispatch First Responders to the caller\u2019s location, and the First Responders they can  dispatch lack the authority to act as First Responders in the jurisdiction in which the caller is  located.
EXPERT	Only the PSAP serving the jurisdiction in which the caller is located will (i) have GIS  information and map displays for the caller\u2019s location, (ii) know which First Responder units are  on duty and available to dispatch to the caller\u2019s location, (iii) know the local First Responder  agencies\u2019 business rules for Emergency Response (the number and type of units to dispatch to  various types of incidents), (iv) know which First Responder units have responsibility for the  caller\u2019s location and/or can reach that location the soonest, (v) have access to radio frequencies  and tone-out systems to dispatch First Responders, and (vi) likely have governmental immunity  for dispatch operations for the caller\u2019s location.3 There have been widely publicized incidents in  which individuals calling 9-1-1 from a VoIP phone had their calls received by a PSAP located in  a different state from the caller.
EXPERT	The manner in which the Commission has dealt with 9-1-1 caller location information for  VoIP is to require that VoIP providers require that their VoIP service users register their address                                                    3 Not all PSAPs have all of these capabilities, but capabilities PSAPs do possess are for the jurisdictions they are  authorized to serve.
EXPERT	7  for 9-1-1 purposes when they establish or log into the service.
EXPERT	This system is only as reliable as  the willingness of the customers to provide their location information, and their remembering to  update this information when they move to another residence or use their device at another  location.
EXPERT	Notably, a VoIP device can be a laptop computer, tablet or smartphone with an Internet  connection.
EXPERT	The Commission should seek solutions in which VoIP caller (VoIP device) locations are  automatically determined and communicated to the 9-1-1 system, rather than relying on users to  manually update their location information.
EXPERT	This could be accomplished by requiring that stand- alone VoIP devices incorporate A-GPS or other location capability, and that computers, tablets,  wireless phones and other devices which can be used as VoIP devices and which incorporate  location-aware technology such as A-GPS technology, allow any applications installed on the  device to access the location technology.
EXPERT	The Commission might also investigate means by  which VoIP providers will be able to detect if a customer/user is using the device or service at a  new or different location than the registered 9-1-1 Address, and prompt the user to update the  registered 9-1-1 Address.
EXPERT	The regulatory status and regime adopted or applied to broadband services must not  restrict the ability of the Commission to implement measures to improve the provision of 9-1-1  location information for VoIP 9-1-1 calls.
EXPERT	IV.
EXPERT	VoIP Providers Must Supply Caller Location Information For Emergency  Notification Services.
EXPERT	9-1-1 Service for wireline telephones rely upon a database which correlates a physical  service address with the telephone number assigned to the service.
EXPERT	When a technician installs a  telephone line and service to a new location, the assigned telephone number is and service  address are entered into the 9-1-1 database.
EXPERT	When a call is made to 9-1-1 from a wireline phone,   8  the PSAP receiving the call uses the number of the phone from which the call was placed to  access the 9-1-1 database, and retrieve the service address associated with that number.
EXPERT	Emergency Notification Services (\u201cENS\u201d), sometimes referred to as \u201creverse 9-1-1\u201d (a  tradename of one of the providers of this service), plot the service addresses of wireline  telephones in a GIS system, and creates a database associating telephone numbers with those  service addresses.
EXPERT	When there is a wildfire, flood, weather event, police manhunt, Amber Alert  or other police action, or other public emergency; public safety officials can designate an area on  a map to receive warning messages, evacuation notices or other instructions.
EXPERT	The ENS service  then identifies all service addresses within the designated area, looks up the telephone numbers  associated with the service addresses, and autodials the numbers and delivers recorded messages.
EXPERT	Agencies and PSAPs with which BRETSA is affiliated have used these systems in cases of  wildfires and chemical spills, for example, to provide pre-evacuation notices and/or evacuation  notices to specific threatened neighborhoods.4    Data is extracted from the 9-1-1 database to create the ENS databases used by many ENS  services.
EXPERT	(BRETSA understands that some ENS services use data from commercial information  sources.
EXPERT	) As noted above, the successor in interest to the former RBOC in Colorado has stated  that it now only provides telephone service to about twenty-five percent of the homes it passes.
EXPERT	This means that telephone numbers for seventy-five percent of homes, as well as for telephones                                                    4 While there are other mass notification methods available including the Emergency Alert System and broadcast  announcements, ENS systems are easily accessed and used by local authorities.
EXPERT	They can also provide more  precision in areas which are notified.
EXPERT	For example, areas and neighborhoods located closest to a wildfire can be  notified first to evacuate while neighborhoods which are not immediately threatened can be notified to prepare to  evacuate.
EXPERT	This avoids more people than necessary crowding onto roads and creating traffic congestion that actually  inhibits evacuation and prevents movement of firefighters into threatened areas.
EXPERT	People who have received a pre- evacuation notice have time to gather possession they wish to take with them, making evacuation more efficient and  orderly if and when they receive notice to evacuate.
EXPERT	Positioning of officers to prevent looters from moving into  evacuated areas can also be more efficiently accomplished when ENS is used to describe specific areas to receive  ENS notifications.
EXPERT	9  at businesses and educational institutions which no longer subscribe to traditional wireline  service, are not automatically included in the ENS database.
EXPERT	For 9-1-1 service, locations of wireless and VoIP callers are identified by wireless and  VoIP service providers and provided to the 9-1-1 System at the time of the call.
EXPERT	Thus, wireless  and VoIP caller/device location information is not included in the 9-1-1 database for use in  populating the ENS database.
EXPERT	Many ENS providers and jurisdictions provide web pages on which residents can  manually register their wireless and/or VoIP numbers and associate them with their residential  and business or educational addresses in the ENS database; but response rates are limited.
EXPERT	Some  facilities-based VoIP providers also sell their VoIP customers\u2019 ENS data (phone number and  service address) to public safety authorities for inclusion in the ENS database.
EXPERT	However  BRETSA does not know of any non-facilities-based ENS providers which supply this  information.
EXPERT	BRETSA has proposed in other proceedings and in a November 21, 2012 Petition For  Rulemaking that Wireless and VoIP providers be required to establish Emergency Information  Service Bureaus through which they would provide ENS data for their customers, additional  customer data which could be used for Emergency Response, and also to verify remittance of  appropriate 9-1-1 Fees.
EXPERT	9-1-1 Authorities and PSAPs would have to certify that the information  was being used for appropriate ENS, Emergency Response or 9-1-1 Fee audit purposes.
EXPERT	Information would only be provided to agencies for investigative or enforcement purposes  pursuant to warrant, to protect personal privacy interests.
EXPERT	BRETSA proposed that service  providers could establish their own service bureaus, or establish jointly-formed nonprofit entities  as service bureaus.
EXPERT	Joint bureaus would spread costs, take advantage of economies of scale,   10  provide one-stop information sources for PSAPs, and allow providers to institute the measures  they deem necessary to protect their proprietary and commercially sensitive information.
EXPERT	More  recently, BRETSA has suggested that companies like Bandwidth.com, Intrado, TCS and other  companies providing ANI/ALI database and NG9-1-1 Services might provide such a service  bureau function.
EXPERT	The regulatory status and regime adopted or applied to broadband services must allow the  Commission and state authorities to require that VoIP provider supply ENS data for their  customers for inclusion in ENS databases, at no cost to public safety authorities or ENS  providers.
EXPERT	This will place all telephone or communications service providers on a level playing  field by requiring that all providers bear the cost of providing this information for their  customers  V. VoIP Customer Location Information Must Be Available For Emergency Response;  And VoIP Providers Must Provide Emergency Contact Information To PSAPs.
EXPERT	Recently, in BRETSA\u2019s April 4, 2014 Comments in PS Docket No.
EXPERT	11-153 (Facilitating  the Deployment of Text-to-911 and Other Next Generation 911 Applications), BRETSA  provided the transcript of a wireless 9-1-1 call and made the recording available, in which an  individual called 9-1-1 to report that his friend had called him and threatened to commit suicide.
EXPERT	The caller provided his friend\u2019s wireless phone number, and the PSAP calltaker contacted the  wireless provider and sought to locate the suicidal individual.
EXPERT	It took over 8 minutes to obtain  location information.
EXPERT	When the PSAP calltaker contacted the PSAP for the City in which the  suicidal person was located, she was told that they had just received a report \u201cless than two  minutes ago\u201d of someone at the suicidal person\u2019s location stepping in front of a semi.
EXPERT	While this example involves a wireless service, PSAPs and First Responders find  themselves trying to locate individuals who have called friends threatening suicide or reporting   11  emergencies rather than calling 9-1-1.
EXPERT	The ability to identify a phone number to a location can be  critical in these situations.
EXPERT	It is important that PSAPs be able to identify and contact a service  provider (or an Emergency Service Bureau for one or more service providers, if the solution  discussed above is implemented) to obtain service address or location or other identifying  information regarding a customer which may assist First Responders in locating an individual.
EXPERT	Currently, PSAPs do not even know what VoIP providers are serving customers in their  jurisdictions or have contact information for such VoIP providers.
EXPERT	They do not have a means of  readily correlating a given telephone number with the VoIP provider supplying the service.
EXPERT	The regulatory status and regime adopted or applied to broadband services must enable  the Commission or the states to implement laws or regulations facilitating PSAPs obtaining  customer information from VoIP providers in emergency situations.
EXPERT	VI.
EXPERT	Caller Location Information Must Be Provided For Nomadic VoIP 9-1-1 Calls.
EXPERT	Nomadic VoIP also poses significant challenges for 9-1-1.
EXPERT	Nomadic VoIP, as BRETSA  understands the term, can include VoIP service where the VoIP device can be moved from  location to location, and would include a WiFi-enabled notebook computer, tablet or mobile  phone which is capable of accessing the Internet through interconnected WiFi access points and  placing VoIP calls.
EXPERT	Based upon BRETSA\u2019s understanding that the Commission prohibits CMRS  providers from blocking Internet-based services provided over a CMRS data plan even though  they may compete with the CMRS providers services; nomadic VoIP calls can also be placed  from wireless phones even while the user is in transit.
EXPERT	In proposing that its text-to-911 requirements be applied to over-the-top text applications,  the Commission has suggested that the APIs of the underlying devices \u201cnative\u201d (CMRS- provider\u2019s) texting application be accessible to over-the-top application developers.
EXPERT	This would   12  allow the over-the-top developer to access and utilize the native application (with location  capability) whenever a text message is addressed to 9-1-1.
EXPERT	A similar solution might also be  adopted when an individual seeks to use an over-the-top VoIP application to place a VoIP call to  9-1-1.
EXPERT	That is, the over-the-top application would access the native CMRS telephony application  (whether GSM, CDMA, LTE including LTE VoIP, etc.
EXPERT	) for the purpose of the 9-1-1 call.
EXPERT	This  would not solve the challenge of providing caller/device location information for purposes of call  routing or emergency response in the case of WiFi only, non-CMRS devices capable of placing  VoIP calls, however.
EXPERT	The regulatory status and regime adopted or applied to broadband services must enable to  Commission and the states to assure that location information is provided for proper routing of  all nomadic VoIP 9-1-1 calls, or that native telephony application APIs be available for VoIP  applications to access for connection of 9-1-1 Calls.
EXPERT	VII.
EXPERT	Independently Marketed \u201cApps\u201d For Public Safety Must Comply With Public  Safety Standards.
EXPERT	There are already an incredible number of smartphone and other device \u201capps,\u201d and more  being created every day.
EXPERT	Many apps provide the same or similar functionalities, but are formatted  differently or given a different look and feel to avoid violation of intellectual property rights and  provide differentiation for marketing.
EXPERT	There are apps being marketed in which users can enter medical and emergency contact  information.
EXPERT	The claim is made that in the event of an accident or medical emergency, First  Responders will look for the person\u2019s smartphone and use the app to obtain medical or health  information for the user and identify the user\u2019s emergency contacts and personal physician.
EXPERT	The   13  problem is that many First Responders have never heard of the applications or the particular  application, and would not rely upon the information in any event.5   With the advent of text-to-911, NG9-1-1 and IP-enabled communications with PSAPs,  new apps are being developed which not only purport to provide information to First  Responders, but to \u201ccontact 9-1-1\u201d and transmit messages and data to PSAPs.
EXPERT	Messages and data  could include user identity, health data, other user-recorded information, real-time health  monitoring information such as blood sugar levels, etc.
EXPERT	The problem is, the vast majority of  PSAPs have five or fewer positions and likely have two or fewer operators on duty at any one  time.
EXPERT	The skill sets for which these individuals are hired includes their ability to multi-task and  their ability to remain calm in an emergency and handle the stress of the position.
EXPERT	It does not  include the ability to efficiently handle different types of data being provided in different  formats, interpret medical or other information, or clear false alarms for commercial application  vendors.
EXPERT	A 9-1-1 operator\u2019s job is to interview callers to determine the nature and location of  their emergency and dispatch First Responders as expeditiously as possible.
EXPERT	BRETSA believes that pictures and video messages to 9-1-1 will delay rather than  expedite dispatch of First Responders.
EXPERT	It will not improve outcomes, and may actually result in  worse outcomes in the vast majority of cases.
EXPERT	Nevertheless, BRETSA assumes that there may be  information and formats which will enhance the effectiveness of Emergency Response and  improve outcomes.
EXPERT	Even these potential benefits may be lost if PSAP calltakers face  innumerable unique data formats, are provided raw data that requires expert analysis, or  automated alarms that include accidently triggered or otherwise false alarms.
EXPERT	It is important that data important for Emergency Response be presented in a common  format with which PSAP operators are familiar.
EXPERT	BRETSA believes that it is important that                                                    5 Where these applications are provided for a fee, consumer fraud may be involved.
EXPERT	14  NENA, APCO, or some other standards organization identify types of data and manner of its  presentation which will be useful for PSAPs and improve Emergency Response.
EXPERT	In addition to  identifying data types when may be transmitted to PSAPs, the standard organization should  assign codes or tags which app developers are to use in transmitting information to PSAPs.
EXPERT	The  PSAP telephone system and/or CAD vendors can then sort the data and format it for display in a  manner consistent with the overall look and feel of their systems and which will thus be familiar  to PSAP operators.
EXPERT	This will enable PSAP operators to have data displayed in a common format  regardless of the app vendor.
EXPERT	It is also important that apps not send automated alarms to PSAPs, whether those alarms  concern premises conditions or emergencies, personal health conditions or emergencies, or other  matters.
EXPERT	Just as with current premises alarms, a high percentage of alarms are false, and the  transmission of these alarms directly to PSAPs would overwhelm the PSAPs and First  Responders and could make them unavailable for real or higher priority emergencies.
EXPERT	Any type  of automated alarm or notification sent by an app must first be intercepted by an alarm  monitoring company which can clear false alarms without involving the PSAP.
EXPERT	Similarly, where an app transmits health or other technical data requiring analysis, such  as blood sugar levels, EKG-type information or measurements of forces involved in a collision;  the data should be sent first to a vendor-provided monitoring point for evaluation and analysis.
EXPERT	Only summary information usable by First Responders should be transmitted to PSAPs, and on  to First Responders, in a form approved by the standards organization.
EXPERT	The regulatory status and regime adopted or applied to broadband services must not  restrict the ability of the Commission and the states to enforce standards for the types and   15  formatting of information which can be transmitted to a PSAP, and to require that certain  information be validated or interpreted and put in a usable form prior to transmission to a PSAP.
EXPERT	VIII.
EXPERT	Users Must Be Able To Access VoIP Services In An Emergency.
EXPERT	In the NPRM, the Commission discusses traffic management techniques including data  throttling, data caps, and prioritizing traffic (QoS).
EXPERT	To the extent that data is not differentiated by  a broadband provider or on the Internet, data throttling or data caps could prevent use of VoIP  service to contact 9-1-1 in an emergency.
EXPERT	It may not be possible to differentiate VoIP calls to  9-1-1 from other VoIP calls or traffic.
EXPERT	To the extent that VoIP calls to 9-1-1 can be differentiated  from other VoIP calls, they should be provided the highest priority and not subjected to throttling  or data caps.
EXPERT	IX.
EXPERT	General Observations Regarding Preservation Of The Open Internet.
EXPERT	Broadband access to the Internet is an essential service for many consumers.
EXPERT	In  legislative workshops on rural broadband during the 2014 legislative session, witnesses spoke of  parents in rural areas driving miles to park their cars near retail establishments with free WiFi on  a nightly basis, so that their children can access the Internet to do their homework.
EXPERT	It appears that  the greater the access bandwidth, the smaller the service footprint and the less competition exists  for the service.
EXPERT	In some areas the broadband service, or high-bandwidth broadband service, has  many of the hallmarks of a natural monopoly.
EXPERT	The Commission and the states also appear to be  on a course towards sun-setting the PSTN and replacing it with broadband service.
EXPERT	Disclosures regarding service specifications and terms of service are meaningless unless  there is effective competition to the service, and providers actually compete.
EXPERT	If there is only one  broadband provider\u2019s service available, or the service offerings of competing providers are  largely indistinguishable, their terms of service are essentially contracts of adhesion.
EXPERT	In addition,   16  some broadband providers constitute great aggregations of wealth before which the rights of the  individual must wither; and the monetary damages an individual consumer may incur are  dwarfed by the costs of seeking effective redress.
EXPERT	The Commission and the states should act in  concert to assure that there are adequate remedies available to consumers which consumers can  afford to access.
EXPERT	Bundling of services by broadband providers would seem to favor the economically  advantaged, and to limit competition from non-facilities-based content or service providers.
EXPERT	At  the same time, bundling can take advantage of economies of scale and make services more  affordable.
EXPERT	Finally, the Commission could adopt a suite of regulations, but apply certain regulations  only upon findings that abuses are occurring, or that there is not effective competition for some  services.
EXPERT	For example, the Commission could implement requirements that (i) broadband  providers publish terms of service or tariffs which must be available to all similarly situated  customers, both end users or edge providers, and (ii) that the broadband provider must impute  the same charges or terms to its own end-user services.
EXPERT	This should level the playing field among  all providers, and prevent a broadband provider from leveraging any monopoly position as an  Internet access provider for the benefit of its own competing services.
EXPERT	In the event a broadband  providers is found to have an actual monopoly in a market however, discriminate, or to be  charging monopoly rates for service, the Commission could apply regulations requiring cost- based tariffs or other measures which would continue until the Commission or a state made a  finding of effective competition.
EXPERT	TELECOM ITALIA comments on  the Federal Communications Commission  NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING  ON HOW BEST TO PROTECT AND PROMOTE   THE OPEN INTERNET  FCC 14-61  July 15th, 2014   Introduction Telecom Italia welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Open Internet  which is currently underway not only in the United States but also in the European Union.
EXPERT	Indeed, new draft rules on Net Neutrality have been included in the EU Commission\u2019s  proposal for a Connected Continent Regulation of September, 11, 2013.
EXPERT	They were  particularly controversial in the run up to the European Parliament\u2019s vote and still  constitute one of the areas of major concern to regulators, operators and public opinion.
EXPERT	We believe that, given the global nature and dimension of Internet and of the relevant  marketplace, a convergence or at least an approximation of the approaches on both sides  of the Atlantic, in particular within the context of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment  Partnership, should be a key goal, albeit indisputably a great challenge, of policy makers in  this particular moment of definition/re-definition of the public policies on such an important  topic.. A global approach on this subject would allow the establishment of the needed level  playing field for players established on both sides of the Atlantic and the balanced and  coherent conditions necessary to boost EU-US trade.
EXPERT	At the outset, Telecom Italia firmly believes that the consumer\u2019s right to access to any  lawful content/application/service of their choice available on the networks is to be  preserved and nurtured.
EXPERT	Such principles were acknowledged by the EU legislator  and  integrated in the EU acquis with the 2009 revision of the Universal Service directive.
EXPERT	At the same time, however, it is necessary to avoid an over prescriptive regulation in this  field.
EXPERT	Indeed, the Internet is an extremely complex and dynamic ecosystem.
EXPERT	Developments  in this area are uncertain and extremely difficult to predict.
EXPERT	Law makers should therefore  adopt a forward-looking approach and carefully consider the risks of a rigid legislation  which may deliver the opposite of the intended effects, stifling investment and innovation  and potentially jeopardizing job growth that depends on such investments.
EXPERT	According to TI, any new regulation should:  x clearly set the consumers\u2019 right to freely access any service/content of their choice  and, on the other side, grant operators the possibility to differentiate the traffic in   order to offer services with different levels of quality and suitable for the evolving  users needs  x not introduce detailed rules, providing for the consumers\u2019 general rights and leaving  the matter to more flexible forms of regulation.
EXPERT	In this regard, TI appreciates FCC  approach to address reasonable network management as well as specialized  services.
EXPERT	Furthermore, all players of the value chain, which is long and complex (network operators,  software developer, content providers, etc.
EXPERT	), should be empowered to compete and should  have en equal opportunity to innovate.
EXPERT	Telecom Italia\u2019s would like to focus on the following main areas:    The Net Neutrality/Open Internet principle    The focus of the Open Internet principle should be the consumers, their ability to access  and distribute information or run applications and services of their choice, ensuring they  derive maximum benefit in terms of choice, price and quality, without interfering with the  technical and operational solutions implemented by the operators managing the  communications networks1.
EXPERT	In the European debate on Net Neutrality, Regulators are envisaging very strict rules  excessively focusing on what network Operators can and cannot do within their networks  without taking into full consideration the impacts of possible restrictions on the actual  benefits that the customers derive from the availability of new differentiated quality  1 As reported on the FCC website \u201cThe principle of the Open Internet is sometimes referred to as "net neutrality.
EXPERT	"  Under this principle, consumers can make their own choices about what applications and services to use and are free  to decide what lawful content they want to access, create, or share with others.
EXPERT	This openness promotes competition  and enables investment and innovation.
EXPERT	The Open Internet also makes it possible for anyone, anywhere to easily  launch innovative applications and services, revolutionizing the way people communicate, participate, create, and do  business\u2014think of email, blogs, voice and video conferencing, streaming video, and online shopping\u201d.
EXPERT	services offered by Operators, without any discrimination, in compliance with the evolving  application and content delivery requirements.
EXPERT	In particular, it should be considered that services are not all the same, and therefore the  conveyed traffic too has to be managed according to the performance requirements  needed in order to make it actually enjoyable by customers.
EXPERT	Hence, enabling customers to  choose between a wide range of differentiated and innovative offers is likewise a priority.
EXPERT	Obstacles to the offers\u2019 diversification would have strongly negative impacts on  consumers\u2019 choice, in particular on customers who would not see fulfilled their  requirements for advanced quality services (such as high-resolution video, tele-medicine,  e-education).
EXPERT	Moreover, without proper actions, the ongoing growth of traffic would result  in a general decline of quality for all users;  In addition, any restriction on the possibility to diversify services will negatively impact on:    - operators who would be deterred from network developments and ongoing  innovation which are in the interest of all players.
EXPERT	The offers\u2019 differentiation,  facilitating business models which allow for quality monetisation, make investments  on network development economically viable;  - other players (such as Content and Application providers, OTTs) who need to be  reached by clients with a suitable quality and would see some contents and  applications loose attractiveness.
EXPERT	Furthermore, they need to be able to offer their  own services/applications/contents to the highest possible percentage of users.
EXPERT	- The entire ecosystem, threatening its sustainable development.
EXPERT	A non-differentiated treatment of all traffic and the impossibility to differentiate quality  levels according to the actual services\u2019 features would not act in a neutral way, since the  provision of some services (such as massive data download) would be unfairly privileged  to the detriment of others (such as time-sensitive services, for example video-streaming,  gaming, videoconference, mobile healthcare, etc.
EXPERT	) independently of the consumer choice.
EXPERT	A non-optimal allocation of network resources would come about, with the paradoxical  result of a lower quality-of-service average for all final customers.
EXPERT	Therefore, those services requiring high quality levels such as, for ex., VPNs for business  users, IP-TV, tele-presence or tele-medicine would be put at great risk, with a significant  impact on innovation and on the ability to choose by customers.
EXPERT	This is, unless we assume  that operators over-invest in order to allow the management of every kind of service and  every kind of quality level under a best effort approach, with conceivable consequences in  terms of cost and price sustainability by customers.
EXPERT	Non discrimination and Commercially Reasonable Practices    Non-discrimination is a principle strongly fostered by both the European and the Italian  regulation.
EXPERT	In particular, in EU legislation, \u201cnon discrimination\u201d implies the application by  the operators of \u201cequivalent conditions in equivalent circumstances\u201d.
EXPERT	The non discrimination principle does not therefore preclude the possibility for Internet  access service providers to offer different prices for services provided with different quality  levels, both at retail and at wholesale level.
EXPERT	Hence, offering a different service at different prices cannot be considered unlawfully  discriminatory.
EXPERT	The availability of differentiated services offered by operators on a no discriminatory basis  allow the user to widen its choice among different offers and to enjoy innovative services  and applications requiring higher performances at application layer.
EXPERT	Under your new proposed rules, broadband providers would be prohibited from engaging  in \u201ccommercially unreasonable\u201d practices (as different from the \u201cunreasonable  discrimination\u201d set by the 2010 Open Internet Order).
EXPERT	What constitutes such a practice  would be determined on a case-by-case basis, relying on a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d  evaluation.
EXPERT	To this purpose a set of factors to guide the application of a General Legal  Standard are proposed.2  2 FCC Notice of proposed rulemaking, par 111: \u201cOur proposed approach contains three essential elements: (1) an  enforceable legal standard of conduct barring broadband provider practices that threaten to undermine Internet  openness, providing certainty to network providers, end users, and edge providers alike, (2) clearly established factors  that give additional guidance on the kind of conduct that is likely to violate the enforceable legal standard, and (3)    Telecom Italia uphold such an approach to the extent it moves in the direction of a flexible  and dynamic enforcement.
EXPERT	Nevertheless, we point out the need to avoid that the criteria  used to carry out such a case-by-case assessment are too rigid and prescriptive because  otherwise that would imply a de facto reintroduction of the unreasonable discrimination  rule, vacated by the DC Circuit.
EXPERT	Moreover the principles of reasonability should not be a  static one, but should evolve dynamically on the basis of the increasing market  competitiveness, in accordance both with the future technological evolution and with the  service innovation.
EXPERT	Reasonable Network Management and Solutions for the Quality of Experience    The use by operators of both Network Management techniques and solutions for the  improvement of the user\u2019 quality of experience is not against Open Internet.
EXPERT	In a context  characterised by a tremendous growth in online voice and video services, as highlighted  by the FCC itself, these mechanisms allow the full openness of the network and the  appropriate users\u2019 quality of experience.
EXPERT	Traffic management measures are being used for the proper functioning of the networks  and has always been essential for the efficient delivery of services: without such measures  networks cannot work properly.
EXPERT	This is even truer as the continuous growth in the Internet traffic creates a challenge for  network operators who have finite capacity.
EXPERT	As reported by Cisco, overall, IP traffic will grow at a compound annual growth rate  (CAGR) of 21 percent from 2013 to 2018.\u201d    In a context characterized by a trend of significant and continuous traffic growth, traffic  management techniques are essential to dispose the increasing volume of traffic without  incurring in a degradation of services to the detriment of all end-users.
EXPERT	encouragement of individualized negotiation and, if necessary, a mechanism to allow the Commission to evaluate  challenged practices on a case-by-case basis, thereby providing flexibility in assessing whether a particular practice  comports with the legal standard.\u201d   Traffic management is a vital means to provide efficient, effective and safe internet  services also in case of critical situations caused by e.g.
EXPERT	serious network faults, hacker  attacks, environment disasters..  Traffic management measures operate at network layer and are necessary in particular to:  x preserve the integrity and security of the network, services provided via this  network, and the end-users' devices  x protect the network from overload conditions: preventing congestion is to be  considered an integral part of the network\u2019s management and cannot be limited to  temporary and exceptional situations but, more properly, it should be aimed at  preventing these situations and eventually at managing them, preserving the  integrity an of traffic and services .3 Traffic management techniques are and must be implemented on a non discriminatory  basis.
EXPERT	The solutions for the quality of experience (QoE) act above the network layer and are  necessary for services requiring high application throughput and low download time (such  as 4K video streaming, interactive gaming, e-health and e-education services).
EXPERT	The technical solutions for QoE improvement (based on Content Delivery Networks,  Transparent Caching, Web Acceleration, Application Delivery, Front End Optimization,  etc.
EXPERT	) aim at improving the applications performance (increasing the application throughput  and reducing the download time).
EXPERT	Content and Application Providers started about fifteen years ago to use these platforms   in the international networks.
EXPERT	It is essential that also domestic fixed/mobile network  operators can deploy and use QoE platforms in order to satisfy the increasing demand for  3 Preventing congestion (load balancing of flows in the network to improve the overall resource usage while avoiding  local traffic bottlenecks when possible; admission control prior to the admittance of new flows in order to avoid that  running services suffer from a lack of bandwidth if new flows arrive while the remaining available physical or logical  bandwidth are not sufficient) and optimising traffic management when congestion occurs (treat flows having a higher  priority prior to other flows; re-route flows to reduce local congestion, etc.
EXPERT	) are part of the traffic management tools  applied at all time on a network.
EXPERT	quality improvement (such as 4K video streaming, interactive gaming, e-health and e- education services) and develop new innovative offers.
EXPERT	Specialized services  Telecom Italia Shares the view that specialized services should be out of the scope of  regulation4 and should be fully managed by operators in compliance with the competition  rules.
EXPERT	Indeed, the specialized service concept correctly responds to the economic logic  according to which incremental investments, incurred to enable the provision of  incremental services, should be remunerated by the service providers.
EXPERT	A fair return on the  investments could be raised by agreements with OTT/content providers requiring services  with certain level of performance.
EXPERT	Otherwise, the only way that would reward operators for  incremental investments would be to pass them on all customers that access the Internet,  with the result of charging innovative services even to customers who are not interested in  their use.
EXPERT	Transparency Telecom Italia believes that the application of a transparency principle is of the utmost  importance for a solid and large scale development of the broadband market around the  world, in that transparency and disclosure of clear and understandable information allow  parties throughout the broadband value chain (users, content and applications providers,  etc.
EXPERT	) to be aware of the features of the broadband services they use.
EXPERT	Transparency allows users to make well informed choices throughout the different stages  of the commercial relationship and select the offers that best suit their needs.
EXPERT	4 FCC Notice of proposed rulemaking, par 60.
EXPERT	Specialized Services: \u201cIn the Open Internet Order [ ] the Commission  stated that it would monitor these services, but that its rules would \u201cnot prevent broadband providers from offering  specialized services such as facilities-based VoIP.\u201d We tentatively conclude that we should maintain this approach [ ]\u201d   Consumers should be able to act on this information by easily switching providers (both  Operators and OTTs).
EXPERT	Removal of barriers to switching is of the utmost importance and  should be a key objective for policy makers, as to ensure that the information that has  been transparently communicated by network operators to end users becomes a useful  instrument in their hands.
EXPERT	On the other hand, the concept of \u201ctailored disclosure\u201d enunciated by the Commission5 is  key.
EXPERT	It is indeed also important to strike a right balance, according to an appropriate cost- benefits analysis, between the efforts required from operators to provide the information  and the level of information, useful and understandable, needed by the users, avoiding  those disclosure, reporting requirements and certifications that, while would impose  excessive burdens and real cost to operators, may not even be meaningful to end users.
EXPERT	#3;   Telecom Italia would like to point out that, in the EU, the revision of the regulatory  framework for electronic communications network and services adopted in 2009 led to the  adoption of a number of provisions that deal with the transparency issue.
EXPERT	In particular, the  Citizens\u2019 Rights directive (art.
EXPERT	20 and whereas 24)6 provides that users must be duly  informed of conditions that may limit they ability to access or use services and  applications, of minimum quality service levels as well as of procedures put in place in  order to \u201cshape the traffic so as to avoid filling or overfilling a network link and on how  those procedures could impact on service quality\u201d.
EXPERT	In addition, we believe that it is important to look at transparency across the entire Internet  value chain.
EXPERT	It is indeed important that all services offered to end users are transparent  and open about the characteristics of offered services and the use of personal data; this is  5 FCC Notice of proposed rulemaking, par 68.
EXPERT	6 Art.
EXPERT	20, Directive 2002/22/EC on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and  services: The contract shall specify in a clear, comprehensive and easily accessible form at least:   #31; information on any other conditions limiting access to and/or use of services and applications, where such conditions  are permitted under national law in accordance with Community law; (..)  #31; the minimum service quality levels offered, namely the time for the initial connection and, where appropriate, other  quality of service parameters, as defined by the national regulatory authorities;(..)  #31; information on any procedures put in place by the undertaking to measure and shape traffic so as to avoid filling or  overfilling a network link, and information on how those procedures could impact on service quality;  #31; any restrictions imposed by the provider on the use of terminal equipment supplied;  Whereas 24, National regulatory authorities should be able to oblige providers to disseminate this standardized  information to all their customers in a manner deemed appropriate by the national regulatory authorities.
EXPERT	When required  by Member States, the information should also be included in contracts.
EXPERT	Dissemination of such information should  however not impose an excessive burden on undertakings.
EXPERT	Member States should require this dissemination by the  means used by undertakings in communications with subscribers made in the ordinary course of business.
EXPERT	valid for services directly provided by the Operators as well as services supplied by third  parties on the Operators networks.
EXPERT	Investments and Innovation  The Internet Ecosystem as we know is based on the innovation and investments that have  followed one another during the years all over the world for each of its components  (terminals, servers, applications and communication networks).
EXPERT	The development of the Internet is still driven by innovation and investments and the  possible breach of this equilibrium would strongly impact the whole ecosystem.
EXPERT	Internet, being a global communication network, is in no way different from all other global  fixed and mobile communication networks: it requires investments that need remuneration.
EXPERT	The public policy on Open Internet needs not to hinder investment, differentiation and  innovation.
EXPERT	A rigid regulatory approach would stifle innovation and investment by the  private sector and provide no help to consumers.
EXPERT	As for any other business, it should be possible for operators to optimize the usage of the  available resources (with the current network capacity), characterizing the delivery of  contents according to the service features and differentiating the offers according to the  content value and the end users needs.
EXPERT	Competition Strict Net Neutrality rules risk to distort competition over the Internet value chain, bringing  benefits to some actors to the detriment of others.
EXPERT	Indeed, a severe principle of non traffic  differentiation would reduce network operators role to mere \u201cdump pipe\u201d and would likely  deprive them of the possibility to bring value to the distribution of OTT content/services.
EXPERT	Moreover, without the possibility to negotiate commercial agreements with Over the Top  players, Telco operators would find it hard to sustain the investments necessary to support  the most innovative - and demanding for the network \u2013 services, with the end result of  discouraging such investments, preventing the provision of services suited to the evolving   needs, harming OTT business and forcing operators to recover the additional costs from  end users (higher internet access fees).
EXPERT	In this way the burden of these services would be borne indiscriminately by all customers,  instead of only by those who actually use them; leading to a sub-optimization in terms of     collective well-being, as some customers would pay the service less then what they are  ready to pay, while others would pay it more than what they are willing to pay.
EXPERT	Telecom Italia maintains that the regulator\u2019s intervention should be limited to setting  general rules to protect customers right to access content and services of their choice  while being neutral with regard to the relationships between the different actors of the  value chain, in order not to frustrate a collaborative approach that would result in an overall  market value increase (OTTs need to deliver their content/services to end users; network  Operators need content/services to appraise their networks).
EXPERT	Conclusions    The \u201cInternet Economy\u201d is characterized by a strong dynamicity and the scenario is  continually evolving, especially thanks to a growing technological and service innovation.
EXPERT	It  is sufficient to consider the mobile connectivity market before and after the appearance of  smartphones and tablets.
EXPERT	In such a dynamic context, we would like to highlight the  following:     1. more flexible tools, adjustable over time, that allow the evaluation of single  operators\u2019 behaviour in relation to the contractually agreed conditions;  2. regulatory interventions of broad reach should be carefully evaluated and a  cost/benefit analysis of possible alternative solutions should be carried out before  taking any action;    3. in any case, any regulation should:   i. set forth consumer\u2019s right to freely access any lawful  content/application/service available on the networks;    ii.
EXPERT	grant operators the possibility to offer their services with different levels of  quality, in order to allow the supply of specific content, applications and  services, based on the implementation of network management techniques  and specific network architectures that ensure the necessary quality of  experience to the end user;  iii.
EXPERT	Ensure the possibility for operators to assure for all services the appropriate  level of quality.
EXPERT	With regard to revisiting the current classification of broadband services as \u201cinformation  services\u201d, Telecom Italia highlights that such decision would probably impact the debate  about the Open Internet regulation at worldwide level.
EXPERT	As above widely discussed, we  consider that a light touch approach to the issue is the best way to support the network  investments in broadband networks, maintaining a right balance with the rights of the  customers.
EXPERT	The development of the US broadband networks and the increasing number of  innovative services available for US citizens confirm that a strict regulation is not  necessary.
EXPERT	On the contrary, regulating broadband services as a public utility under Title II  will prevent operators from an efficient management of their networks and from the  provision of any kind of innovative service based on an enhanced end user quality level.
EXPERT	That would represent a dangerous international precedent driving toward a very restrictive  approach to the Open Internet also in the European Union.
EXPERT	Dear Sir(s) and Madam(s) I urge the FCC to support and enforce Net Neutrality as being in the best interests  of the people of the United States of America.
EXPERT	The Internet is a vital channel for  communication among the citizens of the United States and ISPs as corporate  interests can no more be allowed to decide what traffic travels between entities  than telephone companies can be allowed to decide what calls a person can or cannot  make.
EXPERT	The idea that an ISP would get to prioritize my traffic is intolerable and a  direct threat to freedom of expression as well as being an impediment to my  activities.

EXPERT	Through the Internet, people of color are able to bypass  traditional avenues replete with individual, institutional, and structural discrimination and  insurmountable barriers to entry to embrace new opportunities for self-expression,  entrepreneurship, political participation, education, employment, housing, healthcare, and many  other vitally important human needs.
EXPERT	In order to fully protect the Open Internet, the Commission must take decisive action in  the form of strong, proactive rules that apply equally to fixed and mobile services, and are based  on sound and defensible legal authority.
EXPERT	The Commission must adopt the following rules:   (1) No blocking.
EXPERT	Fixed and mobile broadband providers may not block lawful content,  applications, services, or non-harmful devices;   (2) No unreasonable discrimination.
EXPERT	Fixed and mobile broadband providers may not  unreasonably discriminate in transmitting lawful network traffic, and may not enter into paid  prioritization agreements with edge providers or other similarly situated parties; and   (3) Transparency.
EXPERT	Fixed and mobile broadband providers must disclose the network management  practices, performance characteristics, and terms and conditions of their broadband services,  including any interactions or disputes with edge or transit providers that could impact the overall  quality of service that customers receive or the performance of specific applications or services.
EXPERT	Internet Freedom Supporters urge the Commission to reclassify Internet access service as  a Title II telecommunications service.
EXPERT	As explained by the court in Verizon v. FCC and by the  Commission in its NPRM, rules that prevent blocking and discrimination are common carrier  regulations and can only be enforced using Title II authority.

EXPERT	10-127   COMMENTS OF INTERNET FREEDOM SUPPORTERS  Internet Freedom Supporters,1 by their attorneys at the National Hispanic Media  Coalition, and on behalf of the communities that they represent, respectfully submit these  Comments in response to the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s (\u201cFCC\u201d or \u201cCommission\u201d)  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking soliciting input on how best to protect and promote the Open  Internet.
EXPERT	Internet Freedom Supporters are comprised of civil rights, human rights, and  community based organizations and diverse media makers and entrepreneurs from across the  country.
EXPERT	Internet Freedom Supporters urge the Commission to adopt strong and enforceable  Open Internet rules that prevent blocking, discrimination, and paid prioritization online, while  enhancing transparency requirements for Internet Service Providers (\u201cISPs\u201d).
EXPERT	Internet Freedom  Supporters believe strongly that any rules should apply equally to fixed and mobile services.
EXPERT	Further, Internet Freedom Supporters urge the Commission to reclassify Internet access service  as a telecommunications service so that Open Internet rules are grounded in the firm authority  granted to the Commission in Title II of the Telecommunications Act.
EXPERT	1 For these comments, Internet Freedom Supporters were organized by Voices for Internet  Freedom, a coalition of civil rights and media justice groups led by the Center for Media Justice,  Free Press, the National Hispanic Media Coalition, and ColorOfChange.
EXPERT	A full list of Internet  Freedom Supporters can be found at Appendix A.
EXPERT	2    BACKGROUND  During a recent online speaking engagement in a forum focusing on the importance of the  Open Internet for Latinos, FCC Commissioner Clyburn was asked to explain to the audience the  importance of preserving an Open Internet.
EXPERT	\u201cIf I had to sum it up in one word, I would use the  word \u2018equality,\u2019\u201d she said.2 Commissioner Clyburn went on to say that the Open Internet \u201clevels  the playing field \u2026 [I]t is enabling; it allows for the freedom ... of expression.
EXPERT	It is so important,  particularly with communities who traditionally have been underserved.
EXPERT	This platform \u2026 has the  greatest potential to narrow every, single divide that we know is a challenge in our nation.\u201d3  Internet Freedom Supporters strongly agree.
EXPERT	Beyond the Commissioner\u2019s articulate points, the online event that she attended is  notable for a number of reasons.
EXPERT	The host of the show was a Latina \u2013 a communications expert  and entrepreneur \u2013 who, afterward, wrote a summary of the event for her blog.4 The panelists  that joined Commissioner Clyburn, including Arturo Carmona of Presente.org, were both Latino.
EXPERT	It was broadcast live, in primetime, using an innovative and free online platform that allowed the  host to simultaneously broadcast and connect with multiple on-air guests located in different  parts of the country, from the halls of the FCC in Washington, D.C. to Burbank, California.

EXPERT	3    from wherever they want.
EXPERT	While it would have been impressive enough to use these tools and  diverse experts to present a balanced examination of net neutrality, an issue that has largely been  ignored by traditional media outlets,5 this event went even further to focus on a very specific  angle \u2013 its impact on Latinos.
EXPERT	Simply put, none of this content would exist without a completely open and non- discriminatory Internet.
EXPERT	Gatekeepers would have prevented it from reaching an audience via non- diverse and corporate-conglomerate-owned traditional media outlets, which would have  determined that such a broadcast would not make good business sense due to the perception that  it focused on a niche issue with a small audience \u2013 particularly not in a potentially lucrative  primetime slot.
EXPERT	Neither would the Internet be a feasible broadcast option.
EXPERT	Without openness, paid  prioritization costs to deliver a smooth and seamless live video stream would be prohibitively  high.
EXPERT	Certain web cameras or devices used to capture video by each participant may have been  blocked from using the network.
EXPERT	ISPs may have determined that it would not be in their best  interest to allow such a discussion, and exercised their dubious, self-asserted right to  \u201ceditorial  discretion\u201d to decide not to carry such content through their pipes or degrade its transmission  until it becomes unwatchable.
EXPERT	Without an Open Internet, rather than reaching a global audience  starved of such diverse and timely content, the information shared during the conversation would  have never made its way into the public consciousness, and never enriched the public discourse  surrounding the topic.

EXPERT	4    The divides that Commissioner Clyburn referenced are significant and well documented,  and have been caused or exacerbated by a long and painful history of discrimination in this  country \u2013 both overt and implicit.
EXPERT	People of color are far more likely to live in poverty than  others.
EXPERT	We face an educational achievement gap and lack access to specialized education, like  STEM fields.
EXPERT	It is more difficult for us to access decent housing or healthcare.
EXPERT	We are less likely  to be registered to vote and more likely to be incarcerated.
EXPERT	We are excluded from boardrooms  and newsrooms, relegated to inferior classrooms, and face persistent challenges to obtain equal  access to the capital needed to become creators, achieve ownership, amplify our voices, and  generate wealth.
EXPERT	The advent and expansion of the Open Internet has been an incredible boon to  communities of color, who have been historically underserved due to entrenched structural  discrimination in existing networks and service providers.
EXPERT	On the Internet, opportunities are  infinite, barriers to entry are low, and communities are able to bypass broken legacy systems to  take advantage of innovative offerings better tailored to suit their needs.
EXPERT	Entrepreneurs of color  can succeed without access to traditional financial tools and are able to seek investment through  a variety of crowdfunding or microfinance websites.
EXPERT	Creators and independent content producers  can tell their own stories to defy stereotypes and create positive portrayals of their communities  without needing buy-in from a major media conglomerate.
EXPERT	People of color can engage in the  political process, bringing their voices directly to those in power and going around any  roadblocks designed to impede them.
EXPERT	Beyond making these things possible, the Open Internet  makes them practical and has already brought substantial change to the way members of our  communities view themselves and interact with each other.
EXPERT	5    DISCUSSION  Strong and enforceable Open Internet rules are vital to the well being of communities of  color, and necessary for the advancement of many of the Commission\u2019s policy goals.
EXPERT	Such rules  should be applied equally to mobile and fixed networks.
EXPERT	Moreover, these rules must rest on Title  II of the Communications Act to ensure that they can withstand judicial scrutiny.
EXPERT	I.
EXPERT	STRONG AND ENFORCEABLE OPEN INTERNET RULES ARE  VITAL TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND NECESSARY FOR  ADVANCEMENT OF THE COMMISSION\u2019S POLICY GOALS  The rules that the FCC adopts at the conclusion of this proceeding must protect and  promote the Open Internet so that this tremendous platform, which communities of color use to  control our own images and shape our own stories, can flourish.
EXPERT	To be clear, Internet Freedom  Supporters believe that the rules proposed by the Commission in the NPRM, if adopted, will  create yet another closed platform where the privileged few will be given the tools to succeed  while others will be censored and fall victim to discrimination.
EXPERT	The D.C.
EXPERT	Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the Commission\u2019s justification for  promulgating its 2010 rules was reasonable and adequately supported by the record, in some  instances noting that the threats to openness that ISPs presented were grounded in \u201ccommon  sense and economic reality.\u201d6 Indeed, the Court explicitly affirmed that the FCC had  \u201cconvincingly detailed how broadband providers\u2019 position in the market gives them the  economic power to restrict edge-provider traffic,\u201d7 and that it had \u201cestablished that the threat that  broadband providers would utilize their gatekeeper ability to restrict edge-provider traffic is not,  as the [FCC] put it, \u2018merely hypothetical.\u2019\u201d8 The Commission\u2019s discrimination and blocking                                                   6 Verizon v.

EXPERT	6    rules ultimately lost in court because they were not grounded in the correct legal authority.9 Yet  rather than following the court\u2019s roadmap to propose similar rules under a Title II theory, the  Commission has arbitrarily decided to change course, abandon its 2010 non-discrimination rule,  and propose rules that allow for conduct that has already been recognized as harmful.
EXPERT	Internet Freedom Supporters urge the Commission to adopt the 2010 rules with some  common sense improvements.
EXPERT	The 2010 FCC majority, the D.C.
EXPERT	Circuit, and Internet Freedom  Supporters agree that the 2010 Open Internet Order resulted from a sound assessment of the  threats facing openness, and an understanding that rules of the road would be necessary to  preserve the Internet as a bastion for free expression and a driver of economic growth.
EXPERT	The  Commission should seize this opportunity to improve on its 2010 rules, to undo its arbitrary  decision in 2010 to treat mobile connections differently than fixed connections, to enhance  transparency, and to utilize sustainable legal authority.
EXPERT	To that end, Internet Freedom Supporters  propose that the Commission should adopt the following rules:  (1) No blocking.
EXPERT	Fixed and mobile broadband providers may not block lawful content,  applications, services, or non-harmful devices;   (2) No unreasonable discrimination.
EXPERT	Fixed and mobile broadband providers may not  unreasonably discriminate in transmitting lawful network traffic, and may not enter into paid  prioritization agreements with edge providers or other similarly situated parties; and   (3) Transparency.
EXPERT	Fixed and mobile broadband providers must disclose the network management  practices, performance characteristics, and terms and conditions of their broadband services,  including any interactions or disputes with edge or transit providers that could impact the overall  quality of service that customers receive or the performance of specific applications or services.

EXPERT	The Internet\u2019s Openness Has Created A Level Playing  Field On Which Communities Of Color Can Innovate,  Become Entrepreneurs, Express Ourselves And  Participate In Our Democracy   In the NPRM, the Commission seeks comment on \u201cthe current role of the Internet\u2019s  openness in facilitating innovation, economic growth, free expression, civic engagement,  competition, and broadband investment and deployment.\u201d10 While the Open Internet has  certainly been a game-changing force across society, the opportunities that it has presented for  communities of color, who have been marginalized and shut out of traditional media, have been  truly incredible.
EXPERT	True openness on the Internet, which has existed to this point, has eviscerated  two of the largest barriers to participation by people of color in traditional markets \u2013 lack of  access to capital and inability to bypass gatekeepers.
EXPERT	Due to the Open Internet, the amount of capital needed to fund a venture, be it a small  business or a media property, has plummeted.
EXPERT	Further, when capital is required, it can be  obtained in non-traditional ways from sources across the world, through crowdfunding or other  microfinance options.
EXPERT	Gatekeepers, who have historically picked winners and losers in a number  of industries, are virtually non-existent, and media makers and entrepreneurs can bring their  products directly to their audience.
EXPERT	In terms of political gatekeepers, namely forces attempting to  weaken the political power of communities of color, the Open Internet has allowed our  communities to organize and raise our voices to those in power like never before.
EXPERT	To  demonstrate these points, the Media Action Grassroots Network coordinated an activity through  the social media platform Instagram to gather images of community leaders based primarily in  communities of color who support an Open Internet.
EXPERT	These images, collected from rural to urban  communities across the country, represent the diversity of voices calling on the FCC to truly                                                   10 Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet, GN Docket No.

EXPERT	(1) The Open Internet Has Been A Boon To  Innovators Of Color  The Open Internet has given people of color the opportunity to drive innovation like  never before.
EXPERT	One example can be found in the field of educational technology, in a company  called Qlovi.
EXPERT	Qlovi is a free, K-12 digital reading and writing platform co-founded by three  people of color to address the literacy crisis currently impacting low-income students and  students of color.12 Qlovi co-founder Harlyn Pacheco explained:   I moved to the U.S. in 1991 from Colombia, and I'll never forget how hard  acquiring the English language was for me, or how overwhelmed my educators in  Dallas were in their attempt to communicate with me or my family.
EXPERT	It's our  personal stories and the ones we see around us every day [where we are located]  in Spanish Harlem that motivate our team to continue to discuss culturally  relevant content and provide these literacy services.13     While the innovative web-based platform achieved quick success, its popularity surged  after Qlovi was able to add culturally relevant content.
EXPERT	For instance, in just two weeks after  adding books from Arte Publico Press, the largest publisher of literature by U.S. Latino authors,  Qlovi grew from 10,000 to 70,000 users.14 Growing this business and serving the needs of  diverse schools across the country would be impossible without an Open Internet.
EXPERT	As Pacheco  explained, \u201cThere are hundreds of schools across the country that don't even have libraries, so in  some ways, web-based services are all they have.\u201d15 Pacheco and his Qlovi co-founders have                                                   11 See Appendix B.

EXPERT	Innovative new ways to access capital, such as crowdfunding,  have made it much easier for entrepreneurs to connect with individual investors that are  interested in their goods and services.
EXPERT	Established crowdfunding websites like KickStarter and  IndieGoGo have helped fund a variety of projects for entrepreneurs of color.17  Further, innovative online marketplaces like Etsy have allowed many people of color to  operate successful small businesses online.
EXPERT	Etsy is an online marketplace of more than 1 million  shops that allows customers to buy handmade and vintage goods directly from artists around the  world.18 Etsy, which allows sellers to keep 96.5 percent of the proceeds of each transaction, has a  vibrant community called Etsy Artists of Color, which was organized in 2008 and now boasts  more than 1,300 members.19 Many of these members use Etsy and other websites to operate their  small businesses and make a living.

EXPERT	10    explained: \u201cOne of the main audiences I try to attract are those who want contemporary artwork  featuring people of color.
EXPERT	There have been times when customers will tell me, either through  Etsy, Facebook, or Twitter, that they are happy to find artwork of people that look like them.
EXPERT	And, that\u2019s what makes Etsy a really great marketplace.
EXPERT	It allows art, design, and styles that are  pretty much ignored by the mainstream to congregate in one spot.\u201d20  (3) The Open Internet Supports Free Expression  And Storytelling  The Open Internet has served a vital purpose by allowing diverse voices an opportunity to  represent themselves, make a living, and find an audience.
EXPERT	As Voices for Internet Freedom has  noted, \u201cGovernment policies have historically allowed just a handful of corporations to control  each new media platform.
EXPERT	This is why so few people of color own broadcast TV and radio  stations.
EXPERT	It\u2019s also why, well into the 21st century, many media outlets still depict our  communities in stereotypical terms.\u201d21 Indeed, the FCC\u2019s most recent media ownership numbers  reveal that all of the people of color that own full power commercial television stations in this  country could fit comfortably onto one school bus.22 The lack of ownership of media outlets has  resulted in a lack of participation by people of color in the media, making unbalanced and                                                   20 Maul, supra note 17.

EXPERT	11    stereotypical news and entertainment content the norm.23 It has also impacted the ability of  people of color to make a living in the media industry and has depressed the pipeline of up-and- coming diverse talent.
EXPERT	Thankfully, the Open Internet has provided an opportunity to correct  many of the shortcomings of traditional media.
EXPERT	Ruth Livier, Issa Rae, and Rosa Alonso are just a  few examples.
EXPERT	Ruth Livier  Ruth Livier is an accomplished Mexican-American actress, writer, and producer who has  seized the opportunities created by a truly Open Internet to bypass traditional gatekeepers and  reach an audience with her digital content.
EXPERT	Her award-winning, bilingual web series Ylse has  been hailed as the type of high-quality, stereotype-defying content that is lacking from  mainstream media outlets.
EXPERT	In fact, thanks to the success of Ylse, Ruth became the first writer to  join the Writers Guild of America via work on digital content and 'new media.
EXPERT	'   In a recent notice of ex parte presentation filed with the Commission,24 Ruth recounted  experiences that she had while discussing the show with executives of traditional media  companies, including one who questioned whether or not anyone would want to hear her story.
EXPERT	She also explained how the lower barriers to entry inherent in producing high quality \u2018new  media\u2019 content, thanks in no small part to an Open Internet, made it possible for her to create her  show without a great deal of capital, and allowed her to share her story with people all over the  world.
EXPERT	Ruth mentioned that she views net neutrality as an issue of freedom of speech and  expression.

EXPERT	12    Beyond that, Ruth discussed the lack of opportunities for Latinos and other people of  color in traditional media and contrasted that with the number of opportunities that she, alone,  was able to create for Latino actors, directors, writers, and crewmembers on her own online  series.
EXPERT	She explained how the production of her web series earned her membership in the Writers  Guild of America (\u201cWGA\u201d), making her the first person to join by writing solely \u2018new media\u2019  content.
EXPERT	Further, by maintaining a union production under the WGA, the Directors Guild of  America, and the Screen Actors Guild, she made it possible for many other people of color to  earn credits towards joining a union \u2013 an important step that would add them to a pool that would  facilitate access to additional job opportunities and career advancement.25  Issa Rae  Issa Rae is an African American producer, writer, and director.
EXPERT	According to her website,  her content has garnered over 20 million views and almost 160,000 subscribers on YouTube, she  has made the Forbes 30 Under 30 list twice, and won the 2012 Shorty Award for Best Web Show  for her hit series The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl.26  According to Issa, \u201cThe Internet is where you can find what you\u2019re not seeing in TV and  film.
EXPERT	I\u2019m a fan first; I didn\u2019t see any content of color that I could relate to.\u201d27 With that in mind,  she launched The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl online in 2011.

EXPERT	I can just put it out there.30     By simply giving Issa the opportunity to tell her story and find an audience, the Open  Internet allowed her to earn the opportunity to participate in the media industry and launch a  successful career.
EXPERT	Since then, she has created web content for Pharrell Williams, Tracey  Edmonds and others.
EXPERT	She has worked on developing television projects with well-known show  runners Shonda Rhimes and Larry Wilmore.31 Beyond that, she was invited to co-host a show on  the cable network, Aspire.32 When asked whether the show that opened so many doors would  have been possible without the Internet, she responded, \u201cNo.

EXPERT	15    (4) The Open Internet Facilitates Civic Engagement  And Public Discourse In Communities Of Color  The Open Internet has allowed communities of color to organize for change and  participate in our democracy in meaningful and unprecedented ways.
EXPERT	Organizations that serve  people of color, like ColorOfChange, Presente.org, and others, have achieved incredible results  by mobilizing communities to create positive social change and holding those in power  accountable.
EXPERT	They have also shed light on a number of issues that would have otherwise gone  unnoticed by mainstream media.
EXPERT	Two examples of instances where the Open Internet has  facilitated important public dialogue or illuminated societal problems in the coverage of the  Trayvon Martin story and the courage of DREAMers.
EXPERT	The Trayvon Martin Story  On February 26, 2012, Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African-American boy, was shot to  death by George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida.
EXPERT	Although the story, which involved issues of  racial profiling and unequal protection for young men and boys of color under the law,  eventually became one of the most widely-reported stories involving race in a half a decade,37 it  almost didn\u2019t make it beyond a single report on the local news.
EXPERT	According to an in-depth report on news coverage of the story performed by the MIT  Center for Civic Media, after limited local coverage in the days following the shooting, the news  cycle had appeared to move on.38 However, ten days after the shooting, the story began receiving  attention once again.
EXPERT	According to the MIT analysis:                                                   37 Monica Anderson, As the Trayvon Martin case goes to trial, remembering a major media  event, PEW RESEARCH CENTER (June 10, 2013), http://www.pewresearch.org/fact- tank/2013/06/10/as-the-trayvon-martin-case-goes-to-trial-remembering-a-major-media-event/.

EXPERT	\u2026    On March 14th, while other media channels were still relatively quiet on the  story, there was a strong increase in signatures on [a] Change.org petition  (116,391).
EXPERT	\u2026 Using Change.org\u2019s petition traffic data, we were able to link this  surge of interest back to supportive tweets from a number of celebrities.
EXPERT	Specifically, Change.org employee Timothy Newman elicited supportive tweets  from celebrities such as Talib Kweli, Wyclef Jean, Spike Lee, Mia Farrow, and  Chad Ochocinco, creating a 900 percent spike in social media traffic to the  petition between March 12th and 15th.39     The amplification of this story and participation in the intense public dialogue that it  initiated would not have been possible without the crucial contributions of people of color  online.

EXPERT	DREAMers   DREAMers, or young immigrants who were raised in the United States from a young age  yet were born elsewhere, have long used the tools provided by an Open Internet to organize for  meaningful change of this country\u2019s broken immigration system.
EXPERT	By having the tremendous  courage to share their stories, despite the possibility of facing severe consequences, DREAMers  have changed the face of the immigration debate in a dramatic way.
EXPERT	One incredible example is  the story of Erika Andiola, one of the country\u2019s most prominent DREAMer leaders.
EXPERT	In the early morning hours of January 11, 2013, U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) agents raided Erika Andiola\u2019s home in Arizona and took her brother and  mother into custody.
EXPERT	Shortly after the raid, Erika uploaded a heart-wrenching video explaining  what had happened and posted several messages on social media sites asking for the support of                                                   39 Id.

EXPERT	Presente.org was able to generate more than  20,000 signatures on a petition demanding that President Obama and ICE officials release  Erika\u2019s family.42 By that evening, thanks to the outpouring of support from the community,  Erika\u2019s family was released and yet another moving story of the cruelty of a broken immigration  system entered the national discourse.43   These are just some of the incredible stories that demonstrate the power of the Open  Internet to allow our communities to organize and create positive social change.

EXPERT	By not fully preventing these harmful practices, the Commission  would be stifling one of the most important agents of change of our time.
EXPERT	The NPRM seeks comment on three different approaches to network neutrality: (1)  banning blocking, discrimination and paid prioritization; (2) creating a rebuttable presumption  against such practices; or (3) a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach whereby the Commission would  examine seeming network neutrality violations on a case-by-case basis.44   The Commission must adopt a proactive ban on harmful ISP practices \u2013 the other two  methods are unworkable and place an undue burden on Internet users to police ISP behavior.
EXPERT	The  public is not prepared to shoulder the burden of identifying and challenging harmful conduct.
EXPERT	Indeed, the average consumer is unaware of how Internet traffic management even works, much  less the FCC complaint process.
EXPERT	Even the most sophisticated and well-funded non-profits lack  the capacity to continually fight network neutrality violations.
EXPERT	Solutions that include  presumptions and case-by-case approaches are therefore shortsighted.

EXPERT	Earlier this year, several Comcast subscribers  reported difficulties streaming Netflix content, especially during peak hours.
EXPERT	Though Netflix  requires only 5Mbps for an HD stream, Comcast customers with bandwidth packages of 6Mbps  and much higher still claimed to experience substandard streaming quality.48 According to                                                   46 2014 NPRM, supra note 10 at PP 63-66.

EXPERT	THE FCC\u2019S RULES MUST APPLY EQUALLY TO BOTH FIXED  AND MOBILE NETWORKS OR RISK DISPROPORTIONATE  HARM TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES  In the NPRM, the Commission asks a number of questions concerning whether or not it  should apply the same rules to fixed and mobile service.
EXPERT	Among other inquiries, the Commission  asks, \u201c[h]ow would treating mobile broadband differently from fixed broadband affect  consumers in different demographic groups, including those who rely solely on mobile for  broadband Internet access.\u201d51 Internet Freedom Supporters believe that strong and enforceable  Open Internet rules must apply equally to fixed and mobile services.52 Anything less risks  leaving entire communities behind and frustrating a number of important Commission goals.
EXPERT	Open Internet rules, no matter how robust, will be futile without parity between treatment  of mobile and fixed networks, particularly for communities of color.
EXPERT	Since the initial deployment  of wireline broadband Internet access, low-income, rural, and racially and ethnically diverse  communities have long lagged behind affluent, white communities in the rate of home adoption.
EXPERT	Indeed, the Commission itself has acknowledged that, based on census and subscription data,  people in poor and rural communities are less likely to have access to broadband at their home  than those in wealthy and suburban communities.53 For many, mobile networks help bridge the  digital divide and provide an onramp to the Internet.
EXPERT	Given this reality, Internet Freedom  Supporters agreed with former Chairman Genachowski that \u201c[e]ven though each form of Internet                                                   51 2014 NPRM, supra note 10 at P 106.
EXPERT	52 While we decline to address it here, it is possible that what constitutes reasonable network  management may differ slightly between fixed and mobile networks.
EXPERT	However, it is important  that the definition of reasonable network management not be interpreted so expansively that it  becomes an exception that swallows the rule.

EXPERT	Mobile Parity Will Prevent Second Class Digital  Citizenship For People Of Color   Should the FCC fail to extend the same Open Internet rules to fixed and mobile services,  users in underserved communities who rely exclusively or primarily on mobile broadband for  Internet access could be disproportionately affected by conduct which will have been deemed  harmful to users of wireline products, severely limiting the ability of mobile users to access a  free and Open Internet through the device or service that they prefer or find more affordable.
EXPERT	Mobile parity is essential to ensuring that people of color, who rely disproportionately on  mobile devices as their primary Internet access points, have equal access to the Internet.
EXPERT	74  percent of African American users and 68 percent of Hispanic users reported accessing the  Internet via their cell phones \u2013 in contrast, only 59 percent of white users reported using their cell  phones to access the Internet.55 Notably, 47 percent of African Americans and 60 percent of  Latinos rely on mobile phones as their primary Internet access points.56                                                    54 Julius Genachowski, Chairman, FCC, Speech to the Brookings Institute (Sept. 21, 2009).

EXPERT	23    There is evidence that blocking and discriminatory behavior has already occurred in the  mobile sector from all four of the major carriers.57 For example, AT&T has blocked Apple\u2019s  FaceTime service58 and prohibits users from accessing peer-to-peer file sharing applications or  maintaining network connections (such as through a webcam) without an active user on the other  end.59 T-Mobile has also forbidden users from using peer-to-peer file-sharing applications, and  Sprint had a similar prohibition on webcam network connections.60 Verizon attempted to block  tethering, the practice of using your phone\u2019s wireless data for other devices, such as a tablet or  laptop, until the FCC required them to allow tethering to continue.61 Given these behaviors, it is  clear that the risk of blocking and discrimination by mobile carriers is real, and strong Open  Internet rules are necessary to allow mobile users, who are disproportionately people of color,  unencumbered, open access to the entire Internet.

EXPERT	24    would frustrate the stated goals of Congress and the FCC to close that divide.
EXPERT	Congress has  explicitly directed the FCC to \u201cprovide improved access to broadband service to consumers  residing in underserved areas\u201d; in the National Broadband Plan, the Commission itself claims  that closing the digital divide will require a \u201csubstantial commitment by states and the federal  government alike\u2026includ[ing] initial support to cover the capital costs of building new networks  in areas that are unserved today, as well as ongoing support for the operation of newly built  networks in areas where revenues will be insufficient to cover costs.\u201d62 Open Internet rules that  set two different standards for fixed and mobile broadband would frustrate these policy goals by  stifling efforts to close the digital divide through mobile solutions.
EXPERT	Despite recent efforts to improve broadband adoption rates, a digital divide remains  between people of color and whites, poor and wealthy, and rural and urban populations.
EXPERT	As of  August 2013, 74 percent of white households had adopted broadband technology in the home,  but only 64 percent of African-American and 53 percent of Hispanic households had home  broadband.63  And those who prefer to speak Spanish at home have proven to be one of the most  difficult groups to reach, with only 38 percent having broadband within the home.64  Though mobile devices and networks still have some limitations compared to their wired  counterparts, communities of color often rely on mobile devices to complete a growing variety of  tasks, including making childcare arrangements, receiving health advice, accessing social  services, participating in political issues, finding employment, and engaging with friends and                                                   62 47 U.S.C.A.

EXPERT	(1) Libraries Are Beginning To Lend Out Mobile  Hotspots For Patrons That Lack Home  Broadband And Those Hotspots Should Reach  The Entire Internet  Without equivalent Open Internet rules for mobile services, the impact of programs, like  an innovative new service being offered by libraries, aimed at unconnected members of the  population, would be severely diminished.
EXPERT	Indeed, failing to provide for mobile parity would  actually lock these users into a lower quality Internet service, arguably widening as opposed to  closing the digital divide.
EXPERT	Public libraries, which serve over 96 percent of the U.S. population, have become key  technology and Internet access centers.
EXPERT	62 percent of public libraries report offering the only free  Internet access in their communities, and over 90 percent offer formal or informal technology  training.66 Latino and African-American communities are particularly reliant on public libraries  and the technology services they provide.
EXPERT	Latinos (86 percent) and African-Americans (92  percent) are significantly more likely than whites (72 percent) to consider free library access to  the Internet and computers to be \u201cvery important\u201d to the community.67 These figures make  libraries the perfect anchor institution to stand at the front line of increasing broadband adoption  rates in this county.

EXPERT	The  Chicago Public Library\u2019s \u201cHotspot at Home\u201d program similarly lends mobile hotspots and  laptops to library patrons who do not have broadband access at home for up to three weeks.69   Programs like these demonstrate the power of mobile Internet access to close the digital divide,  and the risks that we face if these services are not adequately protected by strong Open Internet  rules.
EXPERT	(2) Mobile Parity Will Help Bridge The Digital  Divide In Rural Areas  Mobile parity will aid expanded connectivity to an unencumbered Internet in rural areas.
EXPERT	Rural areas have long lagged behind their urban and suburban counterparts when it comes to  broadband penetration and access, and 20 percent of Americans in rural areas still lack access to  wired broadband.70 To overcome the difficulties of reaching rural customers with wired service,  several broadband providers have begun to offer home phone and Internet services through their  wireless networks.

EXPERT	27    wireless solutions, it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between fixed and mobile  wireless home products.
EXPERT	For example, Verizon reportedly markets its MiFi Home, as \u201can  affordable, convenient way to\u2026 bring fast broadband speeds to areas that are not wired for cable  or DSL service, particularly customers living in rural geographies.\u201d71 The MiFi Home, which  provides service over Verizon\u2019s 4G LTE network, connects up to 10 wireless devices and 3  Ethernet-connected devices and can be used for both Internet access and voice telephony and  appears as though it can be easily moved within the home and, perhaps, used in locations outside  the home.
EXPERT	AT&T provides a similar wireless home phone and broadband Internet service over its  own 4G LTE network.72 It is advertised as a home service that is also portable.
EXPERT	In the fine print,  AT&T states clearly that they consider this a "mobile broadband Internet access service" despite  the fact that it is marketed as a home substitute.73 As these devices are increasingly used, both to  connect underserved areas and as a part of upcoming network transitions, the justification for  applying different Open Internet rules to fixed and mobile services weakens considerably.

EXPERT	29    schools with free Internet connectivity for educational devices over its 4G mobile network.80 If  mobile Internet access is not subject to the same Open Internet rules and protections as wired  broadband, then the students who rely on programs such as these will have access to an inferior  quality of service, making it difficult, if not impossible, for them to keep up with other students  who have the means to connect at home.
EXPERT	C. A Variety Of Commission Initiatives Designed To  Address Important Policy Goals Rely On Mobile  Networks And Would Be Frustrated By Unequal  Treatment Of Mobile Connections  Subjecting mobile and wired broadband to different rules would frustrate several of the  Commission\u2019s other policy goals, in sectors ranging from education to healthcare.
EXPERT	This problem is apparent in the Commission\u2019s efforts with regard to mHealth, or mobile  health technologies.
EXPERT	The FCC has devoted considerable resources and efforts into the exploration  of mHealth programs, including hosting an mHealth Innovation Expo in December 2013.81  Inadequate protections in the mobile sphere will deter investment and innovation in these critical  technologies, some of which have the potential of drastically improving the quality of life of  users.
EXPERT	Though some of the large, corporate health and tech companies may be able to afford  prioritization fees, independent developers and entrepreneurs will not.
EXPERT	Raising the barrier of  entry into this field is damaging both economically, to the developers and innovators, and as a  matter of public policy, to the patients who would stand to benefit from the widespread  dissemination and adoption of mHealth applications.

EXPERT	30    This would be particularly harmful for low-income communities and communities of  color, who tend to be underserved by the existing healthcare system and experience significant  disparities in care.82 According to the Center for Innovation and Technology in Public Health:  The high penetration of mobile communications technology among low-income  and [diverse] populations in the United States presents unprecedented  opportunities to improve the health of the U.S. population and reach traditionally  underserved subgroups (e.g., rural communities, low-income groups, and  [communities of color]).
EXPERT	In particular, mHealth solutions offer the potential to  transform safety net care delivery and remove traditional geographic and  economic barriers that these populations typically experience in their access to  care services.83      For mHealth to become the next major wave of healthcare technologies, the  Commission must ensure that mobile healthcare applications will be protected from blocking,  discrimination, and paid prioritization, just like applications accessed through wired broadband.
EXPERT	Disparities between mobile and fixed broadband rules would also impact programs like  the Commission\u2019s \u201cApps for Communities Challenge,\u201d which encourages participants to  \u201cdevelop a software application (app) that delivers personalized, actionable information to  people that are least likely to be online.\u201d84 If mobile broadband providers are free to  unreasonably discriminate, block content, or charge prioritization fees, the mobile applications  created through this program may never reach the groups they are intended to connect.
EXPERT	Programs  like these that encompass both fixed and mobile technologies require a consistent framework  across both types of platforms to be effective.

EXPERT	TO ACHIEVE RULES THAT ADEQUATELY PROTECT AN  OPEN INTERNET, THE FCC MUST RECLASSIFY INTERNET  ACCESS SERVICE AS A TITLE II TELECOMMUNICATIONS  SERVICE  The Commission must utilize the authority granted to it in Title II of the  Telecommunications Act as the only sustainable legal theory available to support the  Commission\u2019s authority to adopt the type of Open Internet regulations necessary to achieve the  FCC\u2019s stated goals in the NPRM.
EXPERT	Despite public remarks to the contrary, the FCC\u2019s proposal to  use Section 706 authority as the basis of Open Internet rules prevents the FCC from enacting  legally sustainable rules to ban blocking and unreasonable discrimination online.
EXPERT	Yet these two  rules are the very crux of the fight for an Open Internet.
EXPERT	Open Internet rules that fail to ban  blocking and unreasonable discrimination are incapable of protecting the even playing field that  President Obama, the FCC, edge providers, the D.C.
EXPERT	Circuit Court and Internet Freedom  Supporters have once agreed was necessary to promote innovation and free speech on the web.85  Rules that amount to anything less than bans on blocking and discrimination and instead create  pathways for FCC review under a case-by-case basis or presumption standards are unworkable,  burdensome to public interest advocates and consumers, and set a dangerous precedent.86  In Verizon v. FCC the D.C.
EXPERT	Circuit Court of Appeals found that Internet regulation  \u201ccomfortably falls within the [FCC\u2019s] jurisdiction,\u201d87 however, the court clarified at the outset of  the opinion that rules preventing blocking and discrimination cannot be advanced under Section  706 of the Communications Act, as the Commission has proposed in this NPRM:                                                   85 Technology, CHANGE.GOV (July 16, 2014, 12:20 PM),  http://change.gov/agenda/technology_agenda/; Preserving the Open Internet Broadband Indus.

EXPERT	32    [T]he Commission has established that section 706 of the  Telecommunications Act of 1996 vests it with affirmative  authority to enact measures encouraging the deployment of  broadband infrastructure.
EXPERT	The Commission, we further hold, has  reasonably interpreted section 706 to empower it to promulgate  rules governing broadband providers\u2019 treatment of Internet traffic,  and its justification for the specific rules at issue here \u2014 that they  will preserve and facilitate the \u201cvirtuous circle\u201d of innovation that  has driven the explosive growth of the Internet \u2014is reasonable and  supported by substantial evidence.
EXPERT	That said, even though the  Commission has general authority to regulate in this arena, it  may not impose requirements that contravene express statutory  mandates.
EXPERT	Given that the Commission has chosen to classify  broadband providers in a manner that exempts them from  treatment as common carriers, the Communications Act  expressly prohibits the Commission from nonetheless regulating  them as such.
EXPERT	Because the Commission has failed to establish that  the anti-discrimination and anti-blocking rules do not impose per  se common carrier obligations, we vacate those portions of the  Open Internet.88      This begs the question: can the FCC ban blocking and discrimination and escape the  judicial interpretation that such action treats ISPs as common carriers in violation of the  Communications Act?
EXPERT	Based on a straightforward reading of Verizon v. FCC, Internet Freedom  Supporters think not.
EXPERT	According to the court,  [g]iven the Commission\u2019s still-binding decision to classify  broadband providers not as providers of \u201ctelecommunications  services\u201d but instead as providers of \u201cinformation services,\u201d see  supra at 9\u201310, such treatment would run afoul of section 153(51):  \u201cA telecommunications carrier shall be treated as a common  carrier under this [Act] only to the extent that it is engaged in  providing telecommunications services.\u201d 47 U.S.C.
EXPERT	S 153(51).89    The court strongly implies, on multiple occasions, that the FCC could reclassify ISPs under Title  II and create a legally sustainable theory on which to rest bans on unreasonable discrimination                                                   88 Id.

EXPERT	33    and blocking.90 On the other hand, the court made it very clear that regulations that seem similar  to common carrier regulations, like anti-blocking and anti-discrimination rules, would be struck  down.91 Indeed, in the NPRM, the FCC itself acknowledges that Verizon v. FCC precludes it  from preventing any discrimination unless it allows for individualized agreements to be struck  between ISPs and edge providers.92    The FCC appears to want to skirt reclassification while at the same time hold itself out as  an Open Internet champion \u2013 but these positions are mutually exclusive.
EXPERT	In the NPRM, the  Commission takes great pains to distinguish the proposed rules from common carrier  regulations.93 It goes so far as to water down the very rules that the court found reasonable and  justified in the first place, all in apparent attempt to sidestep reclassification.
EXPERT	After two failed  attempts at regulating ISPs under Section 706, the time is ripe for the FCC to do what is  necessary, put consumers first, reclassify ISPs under Title II and adopt real Open Internet rules.
EXPERT	CONCLUSION  For the foregoing reasons, Internet Freedom Supporters urge the Commission to codify  strong Open Internet rules that prevent blocking, unreasonable discrimination, and paid  prioritization online, while also enhancing ISPs\u2019 transparency obligations.
EXPERT	Given the fact that  diverse, low-income, and rural communities disproportionately rely on mobile services as their  primary means of Internet access, and that a number of current initiatives designed to bridge the  digital divide rely on mobile technology, Internet Freedom Supporters stress that the  Commission must apply any rules equally to fixed and mobile services, or risk causing great  harm to these communities.
EXPERT	Finally, Internet Freedom Supporters believe that the Commission                                                   90 Id.

EXPERT	2pursuant to its judicially recognized authority under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act  of 1996.4 I.
EXPERT	INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY  Comcast agrees with the Commission that \u201c[t]he Internet is America\u2019s most important  platform for economic growth, innovation, competition, free expression, and broadband  investment and deployment.\u201d5  These benefits are closely tied to the Internet\u2019s openness, which  enables a \u201cvirtuous circle\u201d of innovation, demand for Internet-based content and applications,  and deployment of broadband infrastructure.
EXPERT	Thus, just as Comcast recognized the importance  of the 2010 Open Internet Order and was one of its strongest supporters, Comcast again supports  the Commission\u2019s proposal to adopt new, enforceable rules in furtherance of its goal of  maintaining an open Internet.
EXPERT	In designing these rules, it is essential that the Commission strike  an appropriate balance between establishing effective oversight and promoting investment in  broadband infrastructure.
EXPERT	To achieve this balance, the Commission should follow the D.C. Circuit\u2019s guidance and  base its new rules on Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
EXPERT	This provision, as  interpreted by the court, provides the Commission with ample authority to fulfill its objectives in  this proceeding.
EXPERT	Although the court vacated the Commission\u2019s 2010 no-blocking and  nondiscrimination rules because they improperly imposed common carrier regulation on  information service providers, it also cleared the way for the Commission to adopt sensible and  legally sound open Internet rules that would not run afoul of this prohibition.
EXPERT	This marks the  4  47 U.S.C.
EXPERT	S 1302.
EXPERT	5  NPRM P 1.
EXPERT	3first time that an appellate court has recognized clear legal authority for the Commission to adopt  open Internet rules.
EXPERT	Relying on this authority, the Commission should reaffirm the importance of its  transparency framework, reinstate a \u201cno blocking\u201d rule with a revised legal rationale, and  establish a \u201ccommercial reasonableness\u201d standard to govern direct commercial relationships  between broadband providers and edge providers relating to the transmission of Internet traffic  over broadband Internet access service.
EXPERT	Following this path will enable the Commission to build  confidence across the Internet ecosystem and strengthen the \u201cvirtuous circle\u201d that has produced  abundant benefits for consumers, businesses, and the economy as a whole.
EXPERT	Furthermore, the Commission should adopt its tentative conclusions to limit the scope of  the rules to the provision of broadband Internet access services.
EXPERT	As the Commission and the  Open Internet Advisory Committee (\u201cOIAC\u201d) have recognized, allowing specialized services to  develop without the constraints of open Internet rules has the potential to yield significant  benefits for consumers and competition.
EXPERT	And, to the extent the Commission seeks to evaluate  the marketplace for Internet backbone traffic exchange, it should do so separate and apart from  this proceeding, as the issues presented are distinct.
EXPERT	At the same time, the Commission should ensure that its open Internet rules properly  address services that do involve the provision of broadband Internet access to end users, and to  that end, should carefully examine whether the regulatory distinctions adopted in 2010 between  fixed and mobile broadband services continue to be justified or need to be updated in some  manner.
EXPERT	However the Commission ultimately decides to treat licensed mobile broadband  services, it should apply the same treatment to public Wi-Fi services that offer comparable   4capabilities.
EXPERT	Treating these two categories of wireless services differently would be irrational as  a policy matter and unworkable as a practical matter in today\u2019s marketplace.
EXPERT	In all events, the Commission should not reclassify broadband Internet access service, or  any component thereof, as a Title II telecommunications service.
EXPERT	Doing so is unnecessary  because Section 706 provides the Commission with sufficient authority to fulfill its objectives.
EXPERT	It  also would be unwise in that it would stifle capital investment and dynamic innovation at the  very time the Commission is seeking to encourage the deployment of higher speed services.
EXPERT	And  it would present needless risk as a legal matter, resulting in years of protracted litigation and  uncertainty.
EXPERT	If the Commission\u2019s intention is to protect and promote the development of the  open Internet, and to do so promptly, it should keep faith with the classification decision it made  in 2002, successfully defended before the Supreme Court, and applied further in 2005, 2006, and  2007, especially now that the D.C.
EXPERT	Circuit has recognized the Commission\u2019s authority under  Section 706.
EXPERT	II.
EXPERT	THE COMMISSION SHOULD CALIBRATE ITS RULES IN A MANNER THAT  PRESERVES STRONG INCENTIVES FOR PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT.
EXPERT	Consumers across the nation routinely enjoy access to the open Internet that is one  thousand times as fast as the dial-up access that was prevalent when the Telecommunications Act  of 1996 became law.
EXPERT	Consumers today obtain broadband Internet access service from cable  companies, telephone companies, wireless companies, and even satellite companies.
EXPERT	The vast  increase in speeds, and the growing choice among providers, flow directly from the willingness  of broadband providers to invest and innovate.
EXPERT	Since 1996, broadband providers have invested a staggering $1.2 trillion in their  networks in the United States, which they have used to provide consumers in virtually every   5corner of the country with increasingly robust access to the open Internet.6  For its part, Comcast  offers broadband to over 50 million homes and business, has increased broadband speeds 13  times in the last 12 years, and now provides its residential subscribers with speeds up to  505 Mbps and its commercial customers with speeds up to 10 Gbps.7  These investments are the  foundation of the \u201cvirtuous circle,\u201d giving edge providers a platform to develop and offer  innovative applications that utilize greater and greater amounts of bandwidth.
EXPERT	Broadband  providers\u2019 decisions to make these investments have been driven not by government  intervention, but by vision, opportunity, competition, and consumer demand.
EXPERT	In designing its  rules, it is essential that the Commission strike an appropriate balance between ensuring effective  oversight and maintaining strong incentives for infrastructure investment.
EXPERT	A. Broadband Providers Have Strong Incentives To Continue Providing  Increasingly Robust Access to the Open Internet.
EXPERT	As the NPRM notes, the Commission previously found that broadband providers may  have some incentive to \u201climit Internet openness\u201d under certain circumstances.8  But as the  Commission attempts to regulate conduct theoretically flowing from any such incentive, it must  bear in mind the marketplace realities of the broadband industry.
EXPERT	Providing access to the open  Internet has become an essential component of cable operators\u2019 and other broadband providers\u2019  6 See Broadband, Investment, USTelecom, http://www.ustelecom.org/broadband- industry/broadband-industry-stats/investment (last visited July 8, 2014).
EXPERT	7  Over 21 million customers around the country subscribe to Comcast\u2019s broadband Internet  access service.
EXPERT	Comcast offers service to all households in the communities that it serves,  regardless of race, income, and other demographic factors.
EXPERT	It does not, and cannot under most of  its franchise agreements, refuse to deploy service to certain neighborhoods simply because they  exhibit low levels of demand.

EXPERT	The D.C.
EXPERT	Circuit held this conclusion was \u201cadequately supported and  explained\u201d based on the record before the Commission in 2010.
EXPERT	See Verizon v. FCC, 740 F.3d  623, 645 (D.C. Cir.
EXPERT	2014).
EXPERT	6businesses, and consumers have come to expect and demand the ubiquitous and unrestricted  access that these companies have consistently offered them.
EXPERT	If a provider were to block or  degrade Internet applications or content, the provider would incur substantial subscriber losses  and reputational harm.
EXPERT	Thus, in order to undertake such a strategy, a broadband provider would  first need to conclude that any theoretical benefits of the strategy outweigh these very real costs.
EXPERT	In light of the significant and still-growing level of competition in the broadband  marketplace, it is hard to envision a situation in which this would be the case.
EXPERT	As Comcast has  documented elsewhere, it faces competition from companies providing broadband Internet  access services across a range of technological platforms.9  ILECs provide fiber-to-the-premises  services to a growing number of American households and are upgrading their DSL-based  services, in many cases by building fiber-to-the-node, to offer faster speeds across the country.10 Cable overbuilders, new entrants like Google fiber, municipal providers, fixed wireless  providers, and satellite broadband providers also exert significant competitive pressures.

EXPERT	7well-capitalized and aggressive nationwide mobile broadband providers now offer services that  provide speeds comparable to many of the fixed broadband services that consumers purchase.11 Indeed, even during the short period since the Commission adopted the 2010 Open Internet Order, consumer demand for Internet-based content and applications has skyrocketed,12 and broadband providers have raced to give consumers the best access to the content and  applications that they demand.

EXPERT	9These competitive developments are reflected in the Commission\u2019s Form 477 data.
EXPERT	In  the 2010 Open Internet Order, the Commission relied on the December 2009 iteration of this  data to assess the level of competition among fixed broadband providers.18  The most recently  released round of this data is from June 2013 and thus does not account for significant additional  progress that has been made in the past year.
EXPERT	But even the June 2013 data reveal a remarkable  increase in competition since the Commission\u2019s previous review:    Number of Fixed Broadband  Providers19 % of Households in  Applicable Census Tracts as  of December 31, 2009  % of Households in  Applicable Census Tracts as  of June 30, 2013  At Least 3 28% 78%  At Least 2 76% 99%  At Least 1 97% 100%  Furthermore, in the 2010 Open Internet Order, the Commission concluded that, based on the  2009 data, \u201c[i]ncluding mobile broadband providers does not appreciably change these  numbers.\u201d20  The same cannot be said today:     18 See 2010 Open Internet Order P 32.

EXPERT	Moreover, there is no reason to believe that \u201cswitching costs\u201d would prevent a consumer  from changing among these competitors if a provider were to interfere with his or her connection  to the open Internet.22  Although certain advocates for regulation allege that subscribers are  \u201ccaptive\u201d to their broadband providers, they have failed to provide any evidence indicating that  churn rates are lower for broadband than they are for other services such as video or voice.23 Indeed, a recent survey conducted by Consumer Reports found that 71 percent of respondents  would be inclined to switch to a competing broadband provider if their provider were to \u201cblock,  slow down, or charge more\u201d for certain high-bandwidth content or applications.24  And as the  21  This chart displays the number of households located in census tracts where fixed  broadband providers reported offering broadband Internet access service speeds of at least 3  Mbps downstream and 768 kbps upstream or mobile broadband providers reported operating a  network capable of such speeds.

JOE	Dear Tom, I recently read that the FCC plans to allow "fast lanes" within the internet, allowing certain companies to pay to receive additional speed.
JOE	This is a gateway to destroying the freedom of the internet, and it is disgusting to allow large corporate  entities to control what was until now the ultimate vehicle for free market capitalism.
JOE	I know that you used to work as a lobbyist for the cable companies, just as former FCC commissioner Meredith Baker went from being FCC commissioner to Senior VP of Comcast's Government Affairs.
JOE	I know you are likely being well paid, either directly or with a job offer sometime in the future, to favor the outcome the cable companies desire with regards to net neutrality.
JOE	By placing your personal interests ahead of the public's you are doing irrevocable harm to our nation.
JOE	For a nation that claims to be all about opportunity for the poor we will be rendered hypocrites, taking away the chance for people to start  up their own businesses online.
JOE	The internet will load so much more slowly for any site that isn't paying cable companies that consumers will be less likely to visit any site that isn't being paid for.
JOE	It is inconceivable that you believe  that ending net neutrality would be a positive change for anyone besides major corporations.You are selling out the public good to line your pockets.
JOE	Once net neutrality is ended by the FCC, it will be nigh impossible to revisit the issue.
JOE	Your actions will have hugely negative repercussions for decades.
JOE	I doubt what I'm saying will have much impact on you, but you should be ashamed of what you are doing.
JOE	Mr. Wheeler, There is probably nothing I can say or do to make you reconsider your plans of killing off one of the founding principles  of the Internet, the Net Neutrality.
JOE	The principle, whereby all content is created equal and is delivered at equal speed, sans the content server(s) hosting capacity.
JOE	This simple yet effective arrangement had ensured fair free trade environment whereby content providers paid for costs of hosting and delivery of content, while content consumers paid for delivery of content as well.
JOE	Most importantly, such content delivery equality allowed for Internet to flourish as a medium of content exchange, where popularity of content was simply a function of content originality and/or quality.
JOE	Now, communications monopolies are changing all of that.
JOE	Instead of profiting from competing on speed of delivery or their network capacity, these cartels are demanding a double rent from the same amount of content moving through their  pipes.
JOE	When some content is delivered faster, it's already an unfair practice in the egalitarian world of the Internet.
JOE	Not only would it lead to a sub par quality of "basic" service, but it would also unfairly promote "faster" content as well as "faster" content publishers.
JOE	It would also introduce additional costs in the start-up community business model.
JOE	In addition to the already existing costs of content creation, hosting and bandwidth you are introducing "fast access" cost, which is currently inherent in all of the already existing ISP services contracts.
JOE	ISPs are simple utilities, they do not enhance content or provide any value add beyond delivering it to consumers.
JOE	By allowing this double dipping practices you are placing a lot of entrepreneurs unable to pay additional "fast access" cost at a great disadvantage.
JOE	You are also changing the already existing fabric of the Internet, while supporting another power grab on behalf of monopolistic enterprises that should be broken apart, not granted another carte blanche.
JOE	Many of us in the Internet community realize that you are doing this not because you are unfamiliar with the subject at hand, but because you are an important part of the pyramid of monopolistic power, an agent of consolidation.
JOE	You are the gate keeper, the Chairman of a government agency who is already paid to represent "we the people".
JOE	Not unlike ISPs  which you seem to represent instead, you are clearly seen as someone collecting the rent from these monopolies, in exchange for the rights of the people.
JOE	How effective would Abraham Lincoln be if he had to pay double or triple for his wartime telegrams, because they were "urgent" in nature?
JOE	You should know, you wrote a book about it.
JOE	You were also a  venture capitalist once, helping peer to peer start-ups become viable businesses, which is admirable.
JOE	At that point you should realize just how damaging these "fast access" costs would be to any Internet entrepreneur.
JOE	We can only hope you are able to muster any remnants of your common sense and entrepreneurial good will and do the right thing, namely recognize the obvious fact that ISPs are simple utilities and preserve the Net Neutrality.

JOE	These corporations can say they can make deals with Netflix and other streaming services  to provide a better experience for us.

JOE	You all are public advocates, charged with protecting this nation from the negative actions of corporate interests.
JOE	In this age of the internet, that requires a free and impartial internet.
JOE	Your rule proposal will drive a massive and irreparable hole through that pillar of freedom.

JOE	When do you say \u201cEnough, I\u2019ve had my share.\u201d Instead of choosing to have an internet that is truly free, you have opted instead for a faux capitalist marketing move that will only hinder and slow progression.
JOE	What was once the pinnacle of free market capitalism, you have proposed to create a Frankenstein Monster, fueled by monetary gain and share holders.
JOE	By choosing your financial gain ahead of the good of the public you are doing irrevocable harm to our nation, and our world as whole.
JOE	For a government and nation that claims to be the bastion of freedom, hope, democracy, and opportunity for the people you have done everything within your ability to ensure that only the rich and currently successful succeed.
JOE	It is heinous that you would propose that access to knowledge must be something we should afford, when in fact this access to knowledge should be afforded to us.
JOE	Once Net Neutrality is raped and left for dead by the FCC, it will be next to impossible to revisit this issue; comparable to trying to recover a long dead corpse.
JOE	Now, Tom, I hope you realize what this means for you.
JOE	Right now you are riding the wave of success.
JOE	But waves break, and so will you.
JOE	If this proposal is successful, you will be remembered for the rape and murder of Net Neutrality.
JOE	Your name will stand in history as the man who did everything within his ability to end progression for the sake of the all mighty dollar.

JOE	Dear FCC Commissioner, I recently read that the FCC plans to allow "fast lanes" within the internet, allowing certain companies to pay to receive additional speed.
JOE	This is a gateway to destroying the freedom of the internet, and it is disgusting to allow large corporate entities to control what was until now the ultimate vehicle for free market capitalism.
JOE	By voting for the end of net neutrality you would be doing irrevocable harm to our nation.
JOE	For a nation that claims to be all about opportunity for the poor we will be rendered hypocrites, taking away the chance for people to start up their own businesses online.
JOE	The internet will load so much more slowly for any site that isn't paying cable companies that consumers will be less likely to visit any site that isn't being paid for.
JOE	It is inconceivable to believe that ending net neutrality would be a positive change for anyone besides major corporations.
JOE	Once net neutrality is ended by the FCC, it  will be nigh impossible to revisit the issue.
JOE	Your actions will have huge repercussions for decades.
JOE	I strongly urge you to vote for net neutrality and against corporate control of the internet.
JOE	Thank you.
JOE	Dear Tom, I am worried that your new rules will give more power to the already powerful cable companies.
JOE	Perhaps instead of allowing piecemeal pricing of the internet, you should use your power and influence to ensure that Americans can enjoy  neutral use of the internet for generations.
JOE	As chairman of the FCC, I am sure that you have a greater ability to effect meaning change for millions of people than I do.
JOE	I trust that you will act accordingly.
JOE	Make us proud Tom.
JOE	Sincerely, James Collins.
JOE	Mr. Wheeler, Net neutrality is vital to freedom.
JOE	Around the world you see governments shutting down the internet to attempt to control their populations.
JOE	Killing net neutrality is the first step on a slippery slope to censorship and corporate monopolies on the internet.
JOE	Big corporations already have enough power over the small, independent ones.
JOE	Having any kind of cap or speed limit placed on internet speed for those who can't pay a premium is ridiculous.
JOE	It is clear what happens in other countries when the internet is threatened.
JOE	People will find ways around it.
JOE	This is the first step to angering an already angry and disenfranchised populace.
JOE	Net neutrality must be maintained.
JOE	Sincerely, Eric Nilsson

JOE	I recently read that the FCC plans to allow "fast lanes" within the internet, reversing your stance on Net Neutrality.
JOE	It is unclear whether you deserve to lead the FCC.
JOE	Your job is to protect the majority, the average American, and so your reversal can only mean you or the FCC has become corrupted by money and influence from the Comcasts, Verizons, and AT&Ts of this country.
JOE	The fight for Net Neutrality and access to broadband in general is strikingly similar to the fight for delivering electricity to the American people in the 1930s and it will end no differently.
JOE	The difference now is that the players in that earlier drama are mostly forgotten and now the internet never forgets.
JOE	But it's not too late for you to stand up for us, you know.

JOE	I am a bit apprehensive due to the FCC's last time in court where there was really no fight on the commission's part to contend against the technicality of how current ISPs are viewed.
JOE	In these times, the internet must no longer be considered a luxury but a utility because of everyone's dependence on it.
JOE	I am someone that uses the internet to handle my finances and pretty much fix everything that I can find on Google.
JOE	I pay a very high premium for fast internet even because there is no competition where I live.
JOE	When my connection doesn't work my ISP, TWC, doesn't take care of it in a timely manner because they know there is no other ISP I can go to.

JOE	Tom, It truly sickens me that you are going to go ahead with the allowing of "fast lanes" on the internet.
JOE	The beauty of the internet is that it is an open place where small companies or even ambitious and industrious individuals can make a name for themselves, but when ISPs are allowed to start throttling websites and data at will, that may very well disappear.
JOE	On the FCC's "What We Do" page<https://www.fcc.gov/what-we-do> the bullet points all indicate that your number one roll should be promoting competition and generally creating an environment where the biggest company/person in the room can't crush the little guy before he's on his feet.
JOE	This is clearly not what you and the FCC are doing though.
JOE	In fact, you're doing quite the opposite.
JOE	You may try to distance yourself from the situation by saying that you are only allowing more freedom to the companies  with the cables, but they, as a private company are going to do what ever they can to make money.
JOE	Once they are allowed to segregate traffic between fast and slow lanes, you can bet that there is going to be a premium price on those fast lane slots.
JOE	It is your job as the regulating body of the United States of America to set rules in place that prevent this kind of thing.
JOE	Chances are, you couldn't care less about this email or all the other ones you'll be receiving.
JOE	Heck, you probably have some secretary that screens them and you won't even see this, but if you do, please consider making amends.
JOE	The world deserves it.

JOE	Chairmain Wheeler, I demand that the FCC protects freedom and openness on the Internet by halting this effort to destroy net neutrality The Internet is our most democratic medium.
JOE	It has grown exponentially, fueled innovation and altered how we communicate.
JOE	Network neutrality is the guiding principle that has allowed for these advancements.
JOE	Now, for-profit interests want to violate the principle of network neutrality in order to increase their own profit margins.
JOE	They must not be allowed to destroy the free and open culture of the web.
JOE	I strongly urge you and your colleagues in the FCC to support robust net neutrality legislation that prohibits network operators from blocking, impeding or interfering with any lawful Internet traffic or prioritizing any content or services.
JOE	Sincerely, Ben Elberson

JOE	) tell me how killing net neutrality would be good for anyone outside the offices of Comcast, AT&T, TWC, or Verizon.
JOE	They are doing just fine.
JOE	Instead of investing money to catch up to Google fiber, I guess its better business to buy off the FCC.
JOE	I'm sorry for the harsh tone because claiming people have been bought off who are supposed to be looking out for the peoples interest is harsh but how else are we supposed to interpret this?
JOE	If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, isn't it a duck?

JOE	Mr. Wheeler, I am writing to express my display at your board's decision to allow prioritized access and speeds for certain entities on the Internet.
JOE	The Internet was founded upon a dream of equal access, for all users.
JOE	To allow ISPs to essentially play favorites, the board will choke innovation and kill the independent spirit that made the Internet what it is today.
JOE	Further, it would disincentivise improvement of broadband infrastructure (if companies can make sufficient money from the infrastructure already there, why improve it?
JOE	), increase cost of entry into the business marketplace (how would new players, who don't have the capital to gain priority access, compete with already established players?
JOE	), as well as increase costs for users everywhere (costs for service will be passed down to the consumer, who will be hard pressed to build a competing product due to the second point).
JOE	Many have tried to convince you of these things and failed.
JOE	So I ask you: what evidence do you require?
JOE	Under what circumstances would you be willing to admit that net neutrality is the best option?
JOE	Give me the criteria, and I shall produce them for you.
JOE	Chris Gaetano
JOE	Dear Mr.Wheeler, I am writing to you to protest against proposed rules regarding ISPs being allowed to charge different rates for faster connection speeds.
JOE	These rules will inevitably raise the cost of content produced by major companies such as Disney or Netflix, in order to make the same profit as they did before.
JOE	However, many ordinary people, who aren't chairmen of large companies, will struggle to meet these new prices.
JOE	The government seem to forget that prices are rising everywhere, while people's wages decrease.
JOE	Since I have yet to see an important figure actually care about the 99%, I shall inform you of what may happen to corporations.
JOE	The inflation associated with this new proposal shall turn consumers away from purchasing anything associated with these companies.
JOE	Therefore, they will lose money which will mean you yourself will come under attack from the CEOs.
JOE	You need to realise that you must look to the future and instead not try to make money for the moment.
JOE	The introduction of these changes will also make it much harder to develop more companies online.
JOE	There will never be a new Facebook or Twitter and many other companies will find it impossible to compete against ones that already make billions of dollars a year.
JOE	As we become ever more connected online, companies use the Internet to sell products and reach out to customers.
JOE	They will now start to loose these customers and so will be forced to close down.
JOE	This will increase unemployment rates and will ensure the world will be run by 5 or 6 individuals.
JOE	I tell you to look at the bigger picture for once and do something for the PEOPLE, not large businesses.
JOE	I would advise you to take these arguments to heart and do what is best for the people.
JOE	I know for a fact that I am not the  only one that feels this way.
JOE	Many Anons are dissatisfied with these changes.
JOE	Expect them.
JOE	Yours sincerely, Eoin Campbell.

JOE	Dear Tom, I recently read that the FCC plans to allow "fast lanes" within the internet, allowing certain companies to pay to receive additional speed.
JOE	This is a gateway to destroying the freedom of the internet, and it is disgusting to allow large corporate  entities to control what was until now the ultimate vehicle for free market capitalism.
JOE	I know that you used to work as a lobbyist for the cable companies, just as former FCC commissioner Meredith Baker went from being FCC commissioner to Senior VP of Comcast's Government Affairs.
JOE	I know you are likely being well paid, either directly or with a job offer sometime in the future, to favor the outcome the cable companies desire with regards to net neutrality.
JOE	By placing your personal interests ahead of the public's you are doing irrevocable harm to our nation.
JOE	For a nation that claims to be all about opportunity for the poor we will be rendered hypocrites, taking away the chance for people to start  up their own businesses online.
JOE	The internet will load so much more slowly for any site that isn't paying cable companies that consumers will be less likely to visit any site that isn't being paid for.
JOE	It is inconceivable that you believe  that ending net neutrality would be a positive change for anyone besides major corporations.You are selling out the public good to line your pockets.
JOE	Once net neutrality is ended by the FCC, it will be nigh impossible to revisit the issue.
JOE	Your actions will have hugely negative repercussions for decades.
JOE	I doubt what I'm saying will have much impact on you, but you should be ashamed of what you are doing.
JOE	Thanks, Isaiah Cisneroz
JOE	Dear Mr. Wheeler, With your reversal on Net Neutrality, it's unclear whether you deserve to lead the FCC.
JOE	Your job is to protect the majority, the average American, and so your reversal can only mean you or the FCC has become corrupted by money and influence from the Comcasts, Verizons, and AT&Ts of this country.
JOE	But it's not too late for you to stand up for us, you know.
JOE	History is filled with men who chose to do good despite the hardships.
JOE	You can kill the fast lane and classify internet service providers as common carriers like they should have been classified a decade ago.
JOE	You have the power to fix the errors of those who came before you.
JOE	Or you can obey the lobbyists, ride out the calls for your resignation from people you were chosen to protect, and history will not remember you.
JOE	You have a decision in this, which is more than the rest of us have.
JOE	Mr. Wheeler, My name is Steven Layman and you have never met me and you probably never will.
JOE	That being said you are a very important person to me right now.
JOE	You are one of a view voices that I have to protect my interests in the Internet.
JOE	I do not have enough money to be loud enough in the political spheres to enact any change, all I can do is write this letter and vote my conscience.
JOE	I am a programmer by trade and if I ever hope to reach my ambitions I need the Internet to be free.
JOE	I need the same ecosystem to exist that allowed Mark Zuckerberg create Facebook and Larry Page and Sergey Brin to create Google.
JOE	I am just starting out now and I have my ambitions but in the face of the new rules I fear that my ability to create a successful product is severely limited.
JOE	The media is already controlled by special interests, that is a battle that was lost a long time ago.
JOE	One that I have accepted begrudgingly.
JOE	The beauty of the current internet is that start up media groups like The Young Turks can have a  voice and reach their audience.
JOE	Their message would be filtered and changed to fit the vision of the corporate media structure if they were a part of the CNNs of the world.
JOE	I implore you to rethink this proposal and stand for the people of America.
JOE	I know that their lobbyists are persuasive and  I would be foolish to believe that a nice position is not waiting for you when your time as Commissioner is over.
JOE	I must  humbly ask as one of the people that you were charged to protect to revise your proposed rules to classify ISPs as Common Carriers.
JOE	This is the only way that we can ensure a free and prosperous Internet for the Future.
JOE	Thank you for taking the time to read this email.
JOE	Sincerely, Steven Layman Baton Rouge, Louisiana
JOE	Mr. Wheeler, I could write at length about the pros of maintaining Net Neutrality, but I'm sure you've heard them all many, many times..
JOE	I'll keep this brief: PLEASE take a stand against the current direction the FCC is moving in.
JOE	Maintaining Net Neutrality should be a non-issue: every consumer in the US benefits from strong Net Neutrality laws.
JOE	I realize that lobbyists have a strong pull over policy makers in this country, but I hope that you can realize the immense downsides to the erosion of Net Neutrality.
JOE	Thank you very much for your time, Tom Dickinson
JOE	This is ridiculous.
JOE	I have worked in tech my entire professional career and the only thing Comcast has done is abuse market position.
JOE	It charges me an absurd amount of money for slow, unreliable service and now increases the cost of my Netflix service because Comcast's paying customers want THEIR content to make it through Comcast networks?
JOE	What kind of idiocy would make a government panel look at the existing behavior of America's slow, unreliable and expensive service and think that giving them more power to block innovation is a good idea?
JOE	Sincerely, Justin Carlson Justin Carlson VA
JOE	From reading about your relation to these companies and your apparent apathy for the American people and their critically important, last vestige of free speech, I am emailing to request that you change your stance for the good of the country rather than the good of monopolies and your own selfish interests.
JOE	If you believe at all in the principals of this nation, then you will put aside your own selfish, anti-American ways and do your job and help the American people.
JOE	Tom, By altering net neutrality rules, you are granting unnecessary power to companies that are literally monopolies in many areas.
JOE	This is not the first step and don't claim otherwise.
JOE	Their intent is to "cable-ize" the internet and become the gatekeepers for content.
JOE	You are responsible for opening this door.
JOE	You are serving the lobbyists who line the pockets of public servants.
JOE	THAT is who you serve.
JOE	Shame on you for NOT doing your job and moving to force this bitter pill on the public.

JOE	I find this decision deplorable and I am completely disappointed that the FCC is no longer standing up for consumers, small business', and the fundamental nature of the internet.
JOE	The internet needs to remain open and you need to continue to fight against the largest internet companies fighting to wall off the internet.

JOE	This internet is a free one that should allow no matter how big or small the person it the right to have the same broadband internet as everyone else and with this proposal you are officially allowing companies like Comcast and time  Warner the right to overcharge people to get the same bandwidth there paying now or block the bandwidth of those they do not like at all.

JOE	In allowing for those with far more substantial resources to eliminate competition and eventually screen content to users, you are enabling the literal and tangible destruction of freedom.
JOE	Surely you understand how freedom distinguishes America from the rest of the world if  you work in the United States Government.

JOE	Dear Mr. Wheeler, This is a friendly reminder that you work for the american public, not corporate interests.
JOE	How dare you even think to put your own personal and financial interests over those of the people who you have been called to serve.
JOE	Your actions to further Comcast's internet monopoly absolutely disgust me.
JOE	You should be ashamed of yourself for choosing to line your own pockets rather than protect people from being forced to pay ridiculous amounts of money for shoddy service because they have no other options.
JOE	You will single-handedly set back internet technology and development by decades through your actions.
JOE	It is not too late, choose to do the job you have been called to do and protect the american people from internet monopolies by refusing to allow net neutrality to be repealed.
JOE	Remember your oath to the american people
JOE	Leave the internet open to everyone.
JOE	Please keep access equal for all and abandon your current plan to make it a pay- for-access scheme.
JOE	Robert Heltzel
JOE	The Internet is a public utility, like water or natural gas.
JOE	Users should pay according to how much capacity they use, and  that includes both clients and services.
JOE	No one should have to pay extra to get acceptable performance, as that will lead to only large corporations and wealthy individuals having acceptable performance.
JOE	The Internet is innovative because it is a level playing field, and new entrants can grow rapidly.
JOE	Ending net neutrality will allow the creation of barriers to entry for new companies with new ideas.
JOE	Please reinstate net neutrality and do not approve "fast lanes.
JOE	" Deborah Goldsmith 55 Roberts Rd Unit E Los Gatos, CA 95032 US
JOE	Dear Chairman Wheeler:  I am writing about the new policy your commission has proposed regarding ISPs and "fast lane" internet connections.
JOE	I believe that allowing ISPs to accept money from entities and to change the way users receive internet content would put too much power into the hands of the already rich and powerful.
JOE	As it stands, the internet is a free and open market of ideas and technology.
JOE	Everyone has the opportunity to be heard equally by their peers and this has fostered a thriving community, and amazing and innovative technological developments.
JOE	By allowing large companies to be heard louder than they already are, you threaten the existence and viability of smaller internet operations.
JOE	By allowing ISPs to select which companies get high speed data connections and which ones don't, you protect the interests of huge conglomerates and wealthy CEOs, rather than the users, the common people, our government was designed to protect.
JOE	I know the FCC argues that each proposed "fast lane" client will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, but I worry the commission does not have the man power or resources to adequately and promptly address these cases and I fear large companies and ISPs will take advantage of this fact.
JOE	I'm also concerned with the power lobbyists might have over this process.
JOE	In conclusion, I believe that allowing ISPs to allow "fast lane" privileges is a bad decision as I find large companies and ISPs in general irresponsible with this ability.
JOE	I'm also concerned about the commission's ability to deal with these requests in an accurate, timely, and just fashion.
JOE	Please do not let the golden age of the internet wane on your watch.
JOE	Keep the world wide web open and free.
JOE	Thank you for your time.

JOE	Tom \u201c18-wheeler\u201d Wheeler: I recently read that the FCC plans to allow \u201cfast lanes\u201d within the internet, allowing certain companies to pay to receive additional speed.
JOE	This is a gateway to destroying the freedom of the internet, and it is a dangerous decision to allow large corporate entities to control what was until now the ultimate vehicle for free market capitalism and the unfettered exchange of information.
JOE	I know that you used to work as a lobbyist for the cable companies, just as former FCC commissioner Meredith Baker went from being FCC commissioner to Senior VP of Comcast's Government Affairs.
JOE	I know it is in your best interests to favor the outcome the cable companies desire with regards to net neutrality.
JOE	By placing your personal interests ahead of the public's you are doing irrevocable harm to our nation.
JOE	It is inconceivable  that you believe ending net neutrality would be a positive change for anyone without an army of high powered lobbyists at their disposal.
JOE	You are selling out the public good.
JOE	Once net neutrality is ended by the FCC, it will be nigh impossible to revisit the issue.
JOE	Your actions will have hugely negative repercussions for decades.
JOE	Also, I\u2019ve attached my resume.
JOE	I\u2019m tired of working 60 hours a week for $34,000/yr.
JOE	Help a brother out.

JOE	Mr. Wheeler, I am a 26 year old living in Michigan, working for a Hosted Services Provider.
JOE	We provide infrastructure, servers website hosting and disaster recovery, as a service to small and medium businesses around west Michigan.
JOE	I've never taken a particular interest in politics before now, but the situation regarding the recent changes to the FCC's Net Neutrality laws are setting a truly worrisome direction for our country.
JOE	The internet is arguably the greatest creation of my lifetime, a tool for the free exchange of ideas among anyone.
JOE	Somehow, though, along the way, the United States has fallen leaps and bounds behind other countries in the world, particularly those in Europe.
JOE	Why is this being allowed to happen?
JOE	I know I\u2019m not the only person to wonder if our policy makers understand the gravity of the situation.
JOE	Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T have created an environment that is completely against the spirit of the internet.
JOE	To understand why I am so passionate about the issue of Net Neutrality, let me explain.
JOE	Just today I read that the FCC plans to allow "fast lanes" within the internet, allowing certain companies to pay to receive additional speed.
JOE	This is the first step towards destroying the freedom of the internet, and it is disgusting to allow large corporations to control what was until now the ultimate vehicle for free market capitalism.
JOE	The ISPs claim that this is a cost of business; that companies should pay for the bandwidth they use.
JOE	They already do!
JOE	This is charging twice for the same service, and the cost will undoubtedly be passed right along to the consumer.
JOE	No one in their right mind should support these rulings, but  somehow, Net Neutrality is still eroding away.
JOE	As a hosting services provider, we use a ton of bandwidth in data that comes to us from our customers.
JOE	We already pay a very high price for our connection in the datacenter, let alone what we pay for our connection at our office.
JOE	If we were  to have to start paying more to Comcast on one end and US Signal on the other, and in turn relaying those costs to our customers, there would only be one outcome.
JOE	We can\u2019t compete with these same services offered by Microsoft if ISP\u2019s are allowed to start charging tolls for faster lanes and better access.
JOE	If I may be so arrogant as to cite my youth as a point of expertise on this matter, let me add this: I do not believe that many older Americans, including much of Congress and the House of Representatives, understand exactly what is being  given up by allowing the destruction of the FCC\u2019s Net Neutrality rules.
JOE	I mean no disrespect when I say this: The best advice I can offer to anyone making rulings on technological issues is to listen to your kids.
JOE	Listen to other young Americans.
JOE	This is more than just higher costs for Netflix; it\u2019s a direct barrier to entry for any company or individual wishing to do business online.
JOE	With the destruction of Net Neutrality comes the end of the last decade of technological innovation.
JOE	There is a wealth of voter support to be had for any elected official who takes a pro-Net Neutrality stand.

JOE	I know that you used to work as a lobbyist for the cable companies, just as former FCC commissioner Meredith Baker went from being FCC commissioner to Senior VP of Comcast's Government Affairs.
JOE	I know you are likely being well paid, either directly or with a job offer sometime in the future, to favor the outcome the cable companies desire with regards to net neutrality.
JOE	By placing your personal interests ahead of the public's you are doing irrevocable harm to your nation and encouraging others to do the same when they could be using their position to help and empower the people.
JOE	For a nation that claims to be all about opportunity for the poor you will be rendered hypocrites, taking away the chance for people to start up their own businesses online and choking all but the largest of companies, forcing monopolies and destroying any chance  at a fair market.
JOE	The internet will load so much more slowly for any site that isn't paying cable companies that consumers will be less likely to visit any site that isn't being paid for.
JOE	It is inconceivable that you believe that ending net neutrality would be a positive change for anyone besides major corporations.
JOE	You are selling out the public good to line your pockets.

JOE	I sincerely hope you realise the consequences your actions will have on  what millions of people around the world consider to be the most significant technological breakthrough of the 20th century.
JOE	Sincerely, a concerned human being.
JOE	Net neutrality is what prevents us from censorship.
JOE	If individuals cannot afford to pay for open avenues for all kinds of ISPs, a censorship for the poor is created.

JOE	The Internet has revolutionized our society *because* of Net Neutrality.
JOE	If its structure is changed, then the direct and unfettered access to sites will be changed to one that requires payment for access, since only the big players will be able to pay to speed their content; it will also punish consumers, who will then likely have to pay additional fees to view content, strictly based on profit motives of the ISPs.
JOE	Don't change this -- we need Net Neutrality.

JOE	Chairman Wheeler, The FCC's recent decision for internet 'fast lanes' puts rising startups at risk.
JOE	You are eating away at future potential for our young creatives but lobbying from companies that already make substantial profits.
JOE	ISPs can now make rising companies 'pay the piper' before they can reach solid ground.
JOE	ISPs can now filter content to their liking.
JOE	No self- respecting citizen would believe the half-hearted claims that Verizon has made regarding neutrality if they are free from the government's eye.
JOE	Online innovation is one of the few remaining distinctly American industries.
JOE	Thanks for making it just a little harder in this country.
JOE	Yours, Gabe
JOE	The FCC should be standing up for principles of a fair and open Internet for all.
JOE	Small companies wanting to do business on the Internet have changed the economy as we know it.
JOE	Open access for all content, not paid bandwidth to the highest bidder, is the only way to keep this economic engine alive for all users.
JOE	Allowing large corporations with deep pockets to own the bandwidth and generate huge revenues for a small number of bohemoths is not only unfair, but it is bad for our economy and our citizens.
JOE	Do not place your lobbyist interests above what you know is the right thing to do.
JOE	Ensure the FCC stands for net neutrality.

JOE	I doubt what I'm saying will have much impact on you, but you should be ashamed of what you are doing.
JOE	Hey Tom, I have to say, I was extremely disappointed to see that the FCC plans to push forward with these so-called \u201cfast lanes\u201d of the internet.
JOE	In world where some have more rights than others, the internet was the digital land of equality.
JOE	Everyone  had a voice and everyone had equal access.
JOE	If I created a small time website, I was given the same right of way as some  very large corporations.
JOE	You are working to destroy that.
JOE	You are going to minimize the success of future online startups unless they have the money for those fast lanes.
JOE	The United States should be a beacon of equality, free speech, and this thought that no person or company is better than another.
JOE	What example are we creating for the rest of the world?
JOE	Your actions have consequences that stretch far beyond our borders and beyond our lifetime.
JOE	Remember that.
JOE	This may seem like a great idea for the companies that have no doubt lobbied for this to happen.
JOE	But what happens when you and I die\u2026what will the internet look like for our children?
JOE	This internet where some content is preferred and others suppressed?
JOE	I will say that at some point, this will come back to you if this pushes forward.
JOE	The Internet is ingrained in all of our lives and remember the result of SOPA.
JOE	But instead of it coming back to a few congressmen, it\u2019ll come back to you.
JOE	I don\u2019t have the money that Disney has.
JOE	I don\u2019t have the influence of NBC or Comcast.
JOE	But you and I are people under the same flag.
JOE	We are flesh and bone and should be more important than the will of these larger companies.
JOE	I urge you, work for me and people like me.

JOE	I urge you to change your mind.

JOE	To all: The FCC is inviting ISPs to pick winners and losers online.
JOE	The very essence of a "commercial reasonableness" standard is discrimination.
JOE	And the core of net neutrality is non discrimination.
JOE	This is not net neutrality.
JOE	This standard allows ISPs to impose a new price of entry for innovation on the Internet.
JOE	When the Commission used a commercial reasonableness standard for wireless data roaming, it explicitly found that it may be commercially reasonable for a broadband ISP to charge an edge provider higher rates because its service is competitively threatening.

JOE	Chairman,   As a longtime internet user, I implore you to keep the web an open and level playing field.
JOE	Full net neutrality is crucial to innovation, entrepreneurial activity, and freedom of speech.
JOE	I purchase internet access from an ISP like a utility, and I  expect all content to load equally.
JOE	Allowing ISPs to speed/slow network traffic according to their whim or profit incentive penalizes the consumer and producers of content.
JOE	Frequently ISPs operate in a virtual monopoly in many cities, and have little or no competition.
JOE	This allows them to set arbitrary prices for fast connections, and to easily manage who or what runs on their network.
JOE	It's either their way, or no information superhighway.
JOE	Please do whatever you can to keep net neutrality, and continue the meritocracy on the web that has built and strengthened so many successful online businesses in this country.
JOE	Thank you for your time.
JOE	--Levi Belber   Seattle, WA
JOE	Mr. Chairman: Why is the Federal Communications Commission insisting upon, yet again, revisiting what ought to be a settled question?
JOE	There is no reason, no justification for allowing internet service providers to charge content companies extra for preferential treatment.
JOE	This change will raise prices for consumers and skew content delivery in favor of those will the money to pay for it.
JOE	Content providers willing and able to pay for it (i.e., the Fortune 500) will get more bandwidth from the ISPs, favoring their content regardless of consumer preference.
JOE	Those unable or unwilling to pay the fees (i.e., me and millions like me) will be last on the priority list for having our content distributed.
JOE	This is fair?
JOE	Reasonable?
JOE	Sensible?
JOE	Democratic?
JOE	Constitutional?
JOE	There is no advantage to anyone other than big buck corporations for scrapping the existing rules.
JOE	The internet should be neutral.
JOE	Discussion over.
JOE	Despite what five Supreme Court justices say, money does not equal speech and NO ONE should be able to pay to give their content preferential treatment on the internet.
JOE	The ISPs are making plenty of money under the existing rules; if they \u201cneed\u201d more then let them raise everyone\u2019s rates a little (like any utility) rather than collect a fee to provide unnecessary and unwarranted preferential treatment to the few.

JOE	Fresh out of college from Film School, I was able to land a job support my growing family and continue to grow as a freelancer in the industry I truly wish to be in.
JOE	Net Neutrality allows me the ability to access the worlds most incredible, powerful tool to better myself, and to advertise who I am.
JOE	I want a free and competitive internet for my children and theres.
JOE	That means that if I pay an ISP for internet access, and I also pay another for a content or information service as well, I shouldn\u2019t have to then pay my ISP more money to use it.
JOE	This will  fundamentally shift the balance of power from a even playing field of internet access, to an unbalanced society where livings can\u2019t be made, and boundaries can\u2019t be pushed.
JOE	The internet will not longer be a gathering place of culture or a melting pot of opinions, but a bland, and wealth controlled shell of what it is now, and what it can and should evolve into over the next several decades.
JOE	Please, I plead with you, understand net neutrality and its far reaching effects.
JOE	Use the good that is inherent in you, and the good intentions you act upon to reach out to the experts far smarter than I to ensure your changes and decisions do not ruin the future of this amazing community and culture with price fixing and peering.
JOE	Thank you for your time and humble consideration.

JOE	Mr. Wheeler and Co.,      My name is Charles Walls and I believe that the proposal issued by Mr. Wheeler yesterday would detrimentally change the internet.
JOE	I believe that should the FCC policy change, that the possiblility for it to switch back is negligible, even if it is proven that  the policy does not work.
JOE	Net neutrality has been an issue since the earliest days of the internet, and although this proposal might not be a drastic shift, I believe it is a step in the wrong direction.
JOE	I do not expect you to read this email.
JOE	I expect it to get lost among thousands you recieve today, once the widespread  users of the internet have access to these addresses.
JOE	However, I wish there to be a calm arguement among all of the blind hate you may get.
JOE	Sincerely, -Charles Walls

JOE	Dear Tom, I recently read that the FCC plans to allow "fast lanes" within the internet, allowing certain companies to pay to receive additional speed.
JOE	This is a gateway to destroying the freedom of the internet, and it is disgusting to allow large corporate  entities to control what was until now the ultimate vehicle for free market capitalism.
JOE	I know that you used to work as a lobbyist for the cable companies, just as former FCC commissioner Meredith Baker went from being FCC commissioner to Senior VP of Comcast's Government Affairs.
JOE	I know you are likely being well paid, either directly or with a job offer sometime in the future, to favor the outcome the cable companies desire with regards to net neutrality.
JOE	By placing your personal interests ahead of the public's you are doing irrevocable harm to our nation.
JOE	For a nation that claims to be all about opportunity for the poor we will be rendered hypocrites, taking away the chance for people to start  up their own businesses online.
JOE	The internet will load so much more slowly for any site that isn't paying cable companies that consumers will be less likely to visit any site that isn't being paid for.
JOE	It is inconceivable that you believe  that ending net neutrality would be a positive change for anyone besides major corporations.You are selling out the public good to line your pockets.
JOE	Once net neutrality is ended by the FCC, it will be nigh impossible to revisit the issue.

JOE	Dear Chairmen Wheeler, As a small business owner who relies on the internet I am really upset by the news that the FCC will likely further role back net neutrality.
JOE	My faith in the US government continues to be shaken by the influence large companies like Comcast have on policies that negatively impact consumers.
JOE	The fact that many people at the FCC have worked for the very companies that are lobbying them and will probably work for them after they leave the FCC makes it look very very corrupt.
JOE	Please, remember you work for American citizens at your current job.

JOE	Net neutrality is essential if our society is not to become ever more dominated by rich oligarchs, leaving the rest of us with little convenient access to information, jobs, and other services which we depend on the Internet for.
JOE	Giving the big corporations permission to charge as much as they want for terrible service for the rest of us is the worst idea ever.

JOE	So does this BS.
JOE	The internet should be a free market.
JOE	DO NOT ALLOW Comcast and other big corporations to line your own pocket in exchange for my freedom.

JOE	Good Morning Chairman Wheeler, I believe there are two sides to every story.
JOE	Why do you think allowing selective internet throttling is in the best interest  of the people?
JOE	It really seems to set up an anti-competition environment and encourage/enable censorship from the ISPs.
JOE	But I try to have faith in our public officials' decisions, and I am curious as to your reasoning behind this.
JOE	Is there  a benefit to come out of it that isn't clear to the American public?
JOE	Because from the outside it looks really bad.

JOE	Mr. Wheeler, You have taken the first step in turning the only remaining engine of innovation in the country into a cash cow for one corporation.
JOE	By ceding the governance of consumer Internet to Comcast via the \u2018fast lane\u2019 proposal, you have guaranteed that every other country that does not do this will be able to out-innovate us.
JOE	There is no way conceivable that anyone other than the ISPs will benefit from \u2018fast lanes\u2019.
JOE	The \u2018fast lanes\u2019 will get more  and more expensive, and the service in the \u2018slow lanes\u2019 will get worse and worse \u201cbecause we don\u2019t have the capacity\u201d.
JOE	I had hoped that you would put the good of the country ahead of corporate gain.

JOE	Dear Mr. Wheeler, I am writing to you simply to express my concerns that the FCC has decided to give up on the idea of net neutrality by allowing the implementation of so called 'fast-lane' technology.
JOE	I would like to give a simple analogy as to why this idea doesn't make sense.
JOE	Imagine if the water company the provides the water to your house and your entire neighborhood suddenly had the ability to detect what you were actually using their water for.
JOE	Then they decided to charge a higher utility  rate to anyone  who wanted to make non-Lipton brand tea with their water.
JOE	Suddenly your only choice for tea is either pay for non- lipton brand tea, and then pay the water company for the ability to make non-lipton brand tea... or just cave in and only drink Lipton brand tea for the rest of your life.
JOE	One generally does not have the ability to switch water companies - which further complicates the issue.
JOE	That scenario seems ridiculous.
JOE	So to is the idea of 'fast-lane' technology on the internet.
JOE	Thanks for your time, Maxwell Grady University of New Hampshire Dept.
JOE	of Physics -- Siochain agus Gra
JOE	I would like to register my complaint against your proposed new rules abandoning net neutrality.
JOE	Admittedly, they're not being released unitl May, however the expressed intent has been to go hands off and allow ISP's to seek more profit at the expense of consumers while hiding the price hikes in the subscription fees for other services.
JOE	For instance, consider Netflix and Comcast.
JOE	It's widely known that Netflix has started paying Comcast (who is seeking to purchase Time Warner).
JOE	Now, netflix will be raising it's rate for new customer's, while at the same point, comcast posted a 30% increase in it's first quarter profits (not just revenue).
JOE	Clearing (given the profits), Comcast had the money to expand it's network capacity.
JOE	Comcast's users were the ones requesting all of the bandwidth; Comcast was the one stubbonly refusing to meet this need.
JOE	The end result of this is effectively a hidden price hike, via Netflix, for very profitable broadband providers (whom often already have a monopoly over a region, and can charge whatever they want).
JOE	And your proposed rules would make incidents like this more common place.
JOE	Futhermore, it would encourage ISP's not to upgrade their networks.
JOE	I agree with many others that ISP's should be viewed as common carriers.
JOE	Please reconsider.

JOE	Dear Chairman Wheeler, I am writing about the new policy your commission has proposed regarding ISPs and "fast lane" internet connections.
JOE	I believe that allowing ISPs to accept money from entities and to change the way users receive internet content would put too much power into the hands of the already rich and powerful.
JOE	As it stands, the internet is a free and open market of ideas and technology.
JOE	Everyone has the opportunity to be heard equally by their peers and this has fostered a thriving community, and amazing and innovative technological developments.
JOE	By allowing large companies to be heard louder than they already are, you threaten the existence and viability of smaller internet operations.
JOE	By allowing ISPs to select which companies get high speed data connections and which ones don't, you protect the interests of huge conglomerates and wealthy CEOs, rather than the users, the common people, our government was designed to protect.
JOE	I know the FCC argues that each proposed "fast lane" client will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, but I worry the commission does not have the man power or resources to adequately and promptly address these cases and I fear large companies and ISPs will take advantage of this fact.
JOE	I'm also concerned with the power lobbyists might have over this process.
JOE	In conclusion, I believe that allowing ISPs to allow "fast lane" privileges is a bad decision as I find large companies and ISPs in general irresponsible with this ability.
JOE	I'm also concerned about the commission's ability to deal with these requests in an accurate, timely, and just fashion.
JOE	Please do not let the golden age of the internet wane on your watch.
JOE	Keep the world wide web open and free.
JOE	Thank you for your time.
JOE	Sincerely, Vince Vuono

JOE	Dennis Ruhlin (dennisruhlin@hotmail.com) writes: Dear FCC Commissioner, I read recently the FCC is planning to allow "fast lanes" within the internet, allowing companies to pay to receive "additional speed".
JOE	This is a step to utterly destroying the freedom of the internet in order to raise profits for corporations such as Verizon, Comcast, TWC, etc.
JOE	These large corporate entities will directly control what was until now the ultimate vehicle for free market capitalism.

JOE	For a nation that claims to be all about opportunity for ANYONE we will be rendered hypocrites, taking away the chance for people to start up their own businesses online, to access various news outlets, and to educate themselves.
JOE	Voting against net neutrality will drastically reduce the public's ability to educate themselves by finding information from various sources across the internet.
JOE	The internet will not function as is in it's current state, and will work on a much slower scale due to throttling of  networks and speeds by large corporations, essentially EXTORTION against consumers and business owners who are already paying for access.
JOE	This is, at it's base COERCION, pure and simple.
JOE	It's staggeringly inconceivable to believe that ending net neutrality would be a positive change for anyone besides major  corporations.

JOE	Right now, ISPs are racing to keep up with the growing popularity of bandwidth-heavy content, not just from Netflix, but from every pay-TV operator, Amazon, Google, Apple, countless smaller streaming services, online gaming, video teleconferencing, audio streaming, and more.
JOE	But adding a fast lane takes away much of the incentive to make future innovations available to consumers at large.
JOE	The idea of net neutrality meant that ISPs are motivated to provide the best service for as many customers and content providers as possible.
JOE	But if there is big money to be made off of deep-pocketed media companies trying to outperform each other online, that\u2019s where the focus will go.
JOE	If fast lanes are approved, those content companies unwilling or unable to pay extra for improved delivery will be stuck with the status quo, while those who can part with the cash will see the benefits that everyone would have enjoyed had true neutrality been established.

JOE	However, for people like myself small business who work solely from income earned online, require fair and neutral internet access to content.

JOE	The average bill for internet service is roughly $50.
JOE	That is probably around 5mbps to 8mbps internet access via DSL or bundled with Cable.

JOE	Hi Tom, My name is Eric, I am currently a Computer Science and Engineering major at the University of Michigan, and I am writing to you today to express my concerns with the concept of "Net Neutrality" and the future of a democratic, decentralized, and open internet.
JOE	My concern is that by allowing Internet Service Providers the legal ability to discriminate user access to websites, this will not only force consumers to pay ridiculous monopolized prices for popular services like netflix and google, but would politicize the entire internet.
JOE	Should any ISP decide they want a particular party to win an election, or say they want to cover up some large fiasco, they have the legal ability to deny consumer access to any website that does not align with their views.
JOE	This is a very troubling concept.
JOE	Furthermore, allowing providers to give preferential treatment to content traffic is also unethical.
JOE	Allowing for any one site to have priority over another is not conducive to an egalitarian internet.
JOE	While I admire the efforts to prevent ISP's from blocking or throttling certain websites, allowing ISP's to provide special treatment (at a cost) to content providers would essentially allow a roundabout way of throttling other websites.
JOE	You can't have it both ways: If you believe that ISP's should not discriminate which consumers get to access which sites, then there should be no preferential treatment for certain sites.
JOE	The internet was founded on the concept that every person, regardless of who they were, could access and contribute to the internet.
JOE	By adding discriminatory policies at the most basic level of the internet, the FCC would be destroying the ideals that made the internet such a great resource for humanity.
JOE	I urge you to consider the ramifications of allowing ISP's to control the internet to this extent, and return them to common carrier status.
JOE	Thank you Eric Krawczyk

JOE	I do not want telecom giants and wealthy Internet companies to determine the future of the Internet.
JOE	I want new ideas to flourish on the Internet and not be blocked because they do not have sufficient funds to purchase fast service and compete.
JOE	I do not want the Internet to be turned into another vehicle that allows money to flow from working Americans to the wealthiest -- where web-based services like Netflix purchase faster service and pass the costs on to consumers.
JOE	The proposal being considered would kill rather than protect Net Neutrality and allow rampant discrimination online.

JOE	Internet access is essential for participation--let alone succeeding--in the modern world on both the individual and business level.
JOE	And yet internet access continues to be monopolistic (two companies, but they don't actually compete).
JOE	When so few companies have all the control over the internet, their control needs to be reduced not increased.
JOE	The end of internet neutrality is one more step to the death of the American economy and the hope for individuals and small business to make progress in a world that dramatically skewed to allow only the largest corporation to succeed.
JOE	Most seriously, when the internet is the way that people get and distribute information, the end of net neutrality is the end of free speech and democracy.

JOE	No Internet service provider should be able to meter different sources at different costs!

JOE	We want  net neutrality.
JOE	James Oppedahl IL 61201 US
JOE	Mr Wheeler, I am appalled at the recent turn of events from your administration, and your recent proposal to allow internet providers such as Comcast, Time Warner, and Verizon to use so called internet "fast lanes".
JOE	I am not sure that you fully understand the impact that this move will have on not only the internet as we know it, but to our country.
JOE	Or, maybe the  under-the-table deals from Comcast's lobbyists are enough to make you and your administration not care.
JOE	Nevertheless,  this affects every American and their ability to receive what has become a fundamental human right - an open and politicization-free internet.
JOE	This deal allows ISPs such as Comcast, the ability to charge content providers for streaming traffic or delivering data through their service.
JOE	Providers such as Netflix have already been subject to this mafia style shakedown, which occurred just a few weeks ago when they had to pay purported millions to Comcast just to provide customers with video  streams that didn't buffer every few seconds.
JOE	"Well, that increases the bill for the provider, not the average American.
JOE	",  you might be saying.
JOE	WRONG.
JOE	When Comcast, TWC, Verizon, and the other decreasingly few large ISPs begin to charge every provider, then these fees will be passed on from the content provider to the consumer.
JOE	This is exactly what  Netflix is doing with their price hike that was announced just 3 days ago.
JOE	Additionally, this opens up the question on whether ISPs will be able to lobby to charge extra for access to specific online services or sites in the near future, effectively breaking the internet into packaged tiers.
JOE	The possibilities are endless for the ISPs, and the only people who lose are the average American.
JOE	Allowing these large corporations to "double-dip", by charging Americans exorbitant fees for internet services which are sub-par compared to almost every other country in the world, and then allow them to charge content providers again for the SAME EXACT SERVICE, is beyond my comprehension as an IT Professional.
JOE	Americans aren't stupid Mr. Wheeler, and we can clearly see that preferential treatment is being offered to these corporations in exchange for back room deals.
JOE	Deals such as the former FCC commissioner, Meredith Baker, becoming CEO of Comcast's wireless lobby after allowing the merger of Comcast/Universal.
JOE	And, here we are again with another Comcast merger, and another seemingly corrupt FCC commissioner.
JOE	What do you stand to gain at the expense of the American public?
JOE	I want to challenge you, Mr. Wheeler, to ignore the lobbyists and uphold the job that you were hired to do; protect the American people from Monopolists and unfair business practices.
JOE	The FCC has long been an advocate for an open and truly free internet.
JOE	I ask that you please reconsider and continue to uphold the promise that was made to the American people.
JOE	Respectfully, Mike Arnold Nashville, TN
JOE	We want a permanent iron-clad guarantee for equal-access democratic media, not razzle-dazzle 'em from P.R.
JOE	wizards who think the general public is too stupid to figure this twisted scam out.
JOE	You will never get away with selling out to your corporate masters on this one, we will take to the electronic streets to block you, and you will go down in disgrace.
JOE	We want net neutrality.
JOE	Nothing less will do.

JOE	I recently read that the FCC plans to allow "fast lanes" within the internet, allowing certain companies to pay to receive additional speed.
JOE	This is a gateway to destroying the freedom of the internet, and its disgusting to allow large corporate entities to control what was, until now, the ultimate vehicle for free market capitalism.
JOE	I know you used to work for a lobbyist for the cable companies, just as former FCC commissioner Meredith Baker went from being FCC commissioner to Senior VP of Comcast's Government Affairs.
JOE	I know you are being well paid, either directly or with a job offer sometime in the future, to favor that outcome the cable companies desire with regards to net neutrality.
JOE	By placing you personal interests ahead of the public's you are doing irrevocable harm to our nation.
JOE	For a nation that claims to be all about opportunity for the poor we will be rendered hypocrites, taking away the chance for people to start  up their own businesses online.
JOE	The internet will load so much more slowly for any site that isn't paying the cable companies that consumers will be less likely to visit any site that isn't being paid for.
JOE	It is inconceivable that you believe  that ending net would be a positive change for anyone besides major corporations.
JOE	You are selling out the public to line your pockets.
JOE	Once net neutrality is ended by the FCC, it will be nigh impossible to revisit the issue.
JOE	Your actions will have hugely negative repercussions for decades .
JOE	I doubt what I'm saying will have much impact on you, but you should be ashamed of what you are doing.
JOE	Chairman Wheeler and the Federal Communications Commission, It is my understanding the FCC is poised to enable powerful corporations with lots of money to pay for faster accessibility to their content, thereby limiting the access to information from others.
JOE	It is essential that the internet be available to everyone.
JOE	Please ensure internet neutrality.

JOE	Dear Mr. Wheeler, With your reversal on Net Neutrality, it's unclear whether you deserve to lead the FCC.

JOE	But it's not too late for you to stand up for us, you know.

JOE	Dear Tom, I'm writing to express my utter disgust with the FCC's decision to allow internet providers to create "fast lanes" on the internet.
JOE	Are you really so naive that you think this is anything other than a naked cash by the likes of Comcast and Time Warner?
JOE	These are companies that have a consistent track record of doing everything in their power to hurt consumers.
JOE	Your job, supposedly, is to protect the interests of the American people.
JOE	How will I be helped by this?
JOE	We all know how it's going to shake out.
JOE	Internet providers will throttle the speeds of any company that they consider competition.
JOE	Since almost everyone in this country has only one real option for high speed internet, cable, (this is another terrible situation you're contributing to, by the way) and the cable companies are also media providers, they're obviously just going to use their newfound power in an anticompetitive fashion to prevent any innovation in content delivery.
JOE	You are going to go down in history as the man who helped kill the golden age of the internet.
JOE	This is an absolute disgrace.
JOE	I'm a doctor and a member of the military, and as far as I can tell, all my service is doing is consolidating power in the hands of the few while people like you dance for their table scraps.

JOE	Dear Chairman Wheeler and FCC, Citizens depend on a neutral internet as a vital means of sharing ideas.
JOE	In essence, a neutral internet is a vehicle of free speech for all.
JOE	By enabling the pipe-keepers to give preferential treatment to content providers, the FCC will have begun  the rapid conversion of the internet from a community resource to a commercial nightmare.
JOE	The internet is already compromised by the powerful interests who already have too much control.

JOE	Jonathan Stubbs 900 Acadia Ave Lafayette, CO 80026 US
JOE	Dear Chairman Wheeler, Hearing the proposed changes to net neutrality that are being discussed was highly disconcerting.
JOE	The FCC should be defending an open internet as a public resource; not allowing a few companies, who are notorious for anti-consumer practices, to decide the future of the internet.
JOE	The proposed plan will allow big ISPs to act as content and service gatekeepers, shutting out those who don't pay their toll.
JOE	The internet is one of the greatest contributors to the boom in technological growth we have been experiencing.
JOE	The freedom afforded by net neutrality, as it was previously defined, was a major contributor to this boom.
JOE	I implore you to reconsider these changes.
JOE	The internet should be a public resource, not a profit vehicle for large corporations.
JOE	As a closing thought, remember Americans already pay significantly more each month than citizens of a majority of other countries for internet access.
JOE	Not only do we pay more, but it is for significantly slower service.
JOE	Following through with the proposed changes will only further increase these costs to consumers.
JOE	Netflix is already planning a fee increase as a result of these priority lanes and I'm sure other services will be forced to follow if ISPs have the freedom to  act as gatekeepers of the internet.
JOE	Thank you for your time and please remember the importance of an open internet to the American people.
JOE	Don't expose  us to the cost increases that will follow if the proposed changes are approved.
JOE	Sincerely, Andrew Wiser

JOE	I recently read this article: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/technology/fcc-new-net-neutrality-rules.html And it has concerned me greatly.
JOE	I am a 19-year-old college student who uses the internet constantly.
JOE	I use Facebook, Twitter, and other social media.
JOE	I make YouTube videos for fun and some extra cash.
JOE	I search on Google daily.
JOE	I use sites my teachers use in order to do homework.
JOE	The internet is a massive part of my, and nearly everyone else's, life.
JOE	That is why I am asking you to stop this fast lane law.
JOE	For years, you and President Obama have been advocates of net neutrality.
JOE	Allowing certain companies to pay ISPs extra money for fast lanes, making certain sites faster than others, is not net neutrality.
JOE	It is exactly the opposite.
JOE	It is giving certain sites advantages over others and essentially preventing any small start-up companies in the future from getting off the ground.
JOE	It will also lead to higher, more unfair prices for consumers.
JOE	I cannot think of any positives to this scenario that don't apply to large corporations.
JOE	Please don't let these lobbyists ruin the internet.
JOE	Don't let it turn into the image that I've attached.

JOE	- Alex
JOE	Mr. Tom Wheeler, I am writing to you today to add a voice in support of Net Neutrality, and to support the FCC in keeping the internet open and free.
JOE	Recently, there have been many challenges to Net Neutrality, mostly coming from internet carriers and groups lobbying for them.
JOE	I believe that these groups are attempting to change the laws and the FCCs stance toward Net Neutrality in order to improve internet carrier's bottom line.
JOE	I argue that weakening or abolishing Net Neutrality would harm the U.S.  economy, and significantly reduce the amount of innovation in the technology sector.
JOE	I will explain my reasoning behind these beliefs below.
JOE	I want to provide, as context, that I am a software developer with a decade long background in web site development, and computer data network engineering.
JOE	I reference this only to convey that I have an above average knowledge of internet technology and functioning, and a considerable investment in ensuring that the internet ecosystem thrives.
JOE	An elimination of Net Neutrality will remove one of the great boons to new businesses in the internet sector: equal access.
JOE	Any website, whether for a brand new company with a potentially disruptive service, or the website of a multi- billion dollar company, is equally available to any customer.
JOE	This equal access provides a level playing field for businesses to compete.
JOE	If this level playing field is tilted in favor of any party, it will disrupt these competitive forces and would allow unfair leverage in favor of established companies.
JOE	If, for example, in the early 2000s, Yahoo had been allowed to pay for privileged data speeds and Google was unable to afford this, who is to say if Google could ever had gained a foothold in the market if it had been encumbered by artificially slow load times?
JOE	Because they had a level playing field, Google was able to thrive and now contributes billions of dollars to the U.S. economy, both directly in terms of it's business dealings and salaries paid to it's employees, and indirectly in terms of the greatly increased efficiency for every other business that uses Google technology (which, just taking into account Google web search, is essentially 100% of them.
JOE	) This is just one example of a vital company that contributes enormously to the U.S. economy that may have been snuffed out in its infancy, should it have had to compete on an un-level playing field.
JOE	In addition to the negative effect on the economy that the weakening or abolition of Net Neutrality laws would cause, the internet carriers would in effect be double dipping on charges.
JOE	Internet carriers are already paid for all traffic that crosses their network.
JOE	Content providers, such as Netflix, pay for internet access, and consumers, such as the average person, pay for internet access as well.
JOE	In both cases internet access is paid for at a given speed and reliability level.
JOE	There is no need for internet carriers to charge extra for any given content since they are already paid for the traffic in this way.
JOE	I can say with certainty, that from a technological perspective, that no type of traffic is more onerous than any  other.
JOE	All the data packets are essentially treated identically once they are in the carriers internet backbone.
JOE	Finally, I would argue that internet access is a vital service.
JOE	Increasingly, government services such as tax collection, healthcare.org<http://healthcare.org>, etc.
JOE	rely on internet connectivity to function.
JOE	Moving many of these services to the internet has been a major boon.
JOE	The government has a duty and an obligation to provide equal access to its citizens to its vital services, and anything that can threaten that, such as policy changes that would function explicitly to provide unequal access, should be opposed.
JOE	I would further argue that internet access is vital enough that the FCC should reconsider it's stance toward the status of internet carriers as utilities and/or if they should be subject to common carrier requirements, but that is beyond the scope of this letter.
JOE	I hope this has shown evidence to support the undesirability of weakening Net Neutrality laws and policies.
JOE	There is good reason to believe that weakening Net Neutrality both harm the U.S. economy, serves only to allow internet carriers  to charge more without providing added value, and potentially threatens access to U.S. government services.
JOE	The only upside is that a handful of existing businesses would see an increase in revenue, but at the cost of inestimable harm to every other business in the U.S.  Because of these reasons, I urge you and the FCC as a whole to support Net Neutrality,  and keep the internet free and open.
JOE	Thank you for your time.
JOE	Sincerely, Matthew Feimer (CC: Mignon Clyburn, Michael O\u2019Rielly, Ajit Pai, Jessica Rosenworcel)
JOE	Dear Tom, While I understand the thoughts behind the recent plan to allow internet service providers to charge web services for access to "fast lanes," it's quite obvious to me and nearly everyone else how this will be immediately abused.
JOE	"Fast lanes" will of course come to mean normal speeds and every content provider on the internet who doesn't pay will be arbitrarily restricted.
JOE	This is a horrendous situation for the average consumer, especially given our lack of choice (and dwindling choices for that matter) in ISPs around the country.
JOE	Please take note of the many people who will assuredly be expressing their concerns over this and consider taking action  to prevent such "fast lanes" from being allowed.
JOE	Sincerely, Adam Geary
JOE	When people can't trust the government and don't trust the media they have only themselves to rely on for information.

JOE	In a perfect world competition would take care of the problem, but we live in far from a perfect world with companies enjoying various forms of monopoly privilege.
JOE	I beg you to reinstate net neutrality rules, and to do it right this time.

JOE	Sir, I am retired and on a fixed income.
JOE	I have served our country in Viet-Nam.
JOE	I find your proposal to allow an ISP to charge for favored treatment a gross violation of your position.
JOE	If this so called Net Neutrality regulation is enacted it will allow the already too powerful cable and telecom carriers to act as a de facto gatekeeper for the Internet.
JOE	I would like you to please reconsider this action.
JOE	Thank you.
JOE	-- Stephen W. Brooks
JOE	We the people want action by you and the Commission to protect and further democratic media, not platitudes that are merely smokescreens for corporate domination of the Internet.
JOE	We want net neutrality.
JOE	Net neutrality is the only way to protect the interests of the vast majority of Americans!

JOE	The internet has become a mandatory part of every day life.
JOE	Without it, we cannot work, buy things, or even pay bills.
JOE	The cable companies and telecoms have already secured a monopoly for themselves, so despite Comcast being voted the worst company in America, citizens have no choice but to buy their poor service.
JOE	We need competition, not rules that further increase their control.
JOE	The ability for Comcast and other ISPs to block services that compete with their own is anti-competitive, and you know it.
JOE	Comcast should be split up, not given ultimate power over we we see and hear.
JOE	Please regulate the internet like the public utility it is.

JOE	Dear Tom, I recently read that the FCC plans to allow "fast lanes" within the internet, allowing certain companies to pay to receive additional speed.
JOE	This is a gateway to destroying the freedom of the internet, and it is disgusting to allow large corporate  entities to control what was until now the ultimate vehicle for free market capitalism.
JOE	I know that you used to work as a lobbyist for the cable companies, just as former FCC commissioner Meredith Baker went from being FCC commissioner to Senior VP of Comcast's Government Affairs.
JOE	I know you are likely being well paid, either directly or with a job offer sometime in the future, to favor the outcome the cable companies desire with regards to net neutrality.
JOE	By placing your personal interests ahead of the public's you are doing irrevocable harm to our nation.
JOE	For a nation that claims to be all about opportunity we will be rendered hypocrites, taking away the chance for people to start up their own businesses online.
JOE	Under these plans, the internet will load much more slowly for any site that isn't paying cable companies.
JOE	This will directly impact the decisions that consumers make.
JOE	Driving down traffic to any site that isn't being paid for.
JOE	It is inconceivable that you believe that ending net neutrality would be a positive change for anyone besides major corporations.
JOE	You are selling out the public good to line your pockets.
JOE	Once net neutrality is ended by the FCC, it will be nigh impossible to revisit the issue.
JOE	Some historical perspective<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2005/06/27/AR2005062700415.html>: Back in the early 2000s the ISP market was destroyed.
JOE	The cable and phone companies were allowed to ban all competing ISPs from offering services on their lines.
JOE	Everybody said "they're going to abuse their new government-granted monopoly.
JOE	"    A key concern is that phone and cable companies could potentially use their power over the network to act as gatekeepers of the Internet, discriminating and limiting consumers' access to certain services so that some Web sites and  online services are favored.
JOE	Opponents of yesterday's ruling said they would push the FCC and Capitol Hill to codify rules ensuring the "network neutrality" on the Internet.
JOE	"The ballgame becomes now how each of the two industries that controls a wire can determine what content, what access, at what speed consumers and technologists can offer and retrieve services over those networks," said Gene Kimmelman, senior director of Consumers Union.
JOE	And here we are.
JOE	Your actions will have hugely negative repercussions for decades.
JOE	I doubt what I'm saying will have much impact on you, but you should be ashamed of what you are doing.
JOE	William M. Alam (commerce@fastmail.fm) writes: Dear Chairman Wheeler, "Nice data packets you have there.
JOE	Be a pity if something was to happen to them.
JOE	" A tiered Internet is nothing but a protection racket.
JOE	A web site pays a premium so that its packages will be "expedited" (i.e., not deliberately delayed).
JOE	It will harm small businesses that depend on ISPs to act as common carriers and do great damage to our economy.
JOE	The cablecos and telcos want to do this so they can extract more revenue from the same infrastructure.
JOE	I'd wager anticipation has already caused a slow-down of infrastructure projects.
JOE	The United States already lags the rest of the developed world in the quality of its Internet service.
JOE	We cannot afford to fall farther behind.
JOE	In the long run, your decision will even harm the carriers.
JOE	They need a healthy economy, too, if they are to have customers.
JOE	Do not end net neutrality.
JOE	The Internet works.
JOE	Don't fix it.

JOE	Hello, Recent reports suggest that the FCC is planning to undermine Net Neutrality by allowing a data fast-lane for heavy- traffic services and charge more for such.
JOE	This is flat-out wrong.
JOE	The Internet is created to be equal and fair.
JOE	No-one gave the FCC the right to change that, and we  won't stand for it.
JOE	The FCC will be boycotted if such proposals turn out to be true, as well as the huge economic implications this will cause.
JOE	G'day.
JOE	Mr. Wheeler, You are aware that your new \u201cnet neutrality\u201d rules are the opposite of what net neutrality actually is, will stifle innovation, and will be detrimental to small/medium size web businesses?
JOE	The internet has become a cornerstone of the  future and while it\u2019s embraced by a majority of the planet you are willing to throw it all away at the whim of the cable providers.
JOE	This country will continue to fall behind others in regards to web accessibility, education, and technology all because you\u2019re an ex-cable lobbyist who cares more about money than patriotism.
JOE	I\u2019m a web developer/small business owner and I\u2019m more than aware how the internet works.
JOE	The \u201clast-mile\u201d of bandwidth that the ISPs are attempting to charge content providers for are already paid for by the internet consumer.
JOE	Here in Washington DC a 50Mbps connection (via Comcast) will cost an average of $112 per month.
JOE	The EXACT SAME connection in Seoul (via HelloVision) will cost less than $15 per month.
JOE	Here in the US Google is proving internet connections that are 20 times faster than FiOS for cheaper.
JOE	Verizon made a staggering $5 billion PROFIT in the 4th quarter of 2013 alone.
JOE	Clearly Netflix/Hulu/etc are not causing undue burden on their network or profit margin.
JOE	This is clearly a grab for extra money pure and simple.
JOE	It saddens me that you are so willing to destroy small business and throw away the future of our country for a few extra dollars.
JOE	If this goes through, and you don\u2019t implement a true free and open internet I will vote against any candidate in any election that will employ you in any capacity.
JOE	The only road forward is the path that every other country on the planet is taking.
JOE	The cable providers MUST treat every packet the exact same way regardless of where they came from or where they are going.
JOE	Thanks, Steve Koeniger
JOE	Dear FCC, I am writing to oppose rules that will allow for discrimination on the Internet - where the wealthy can purchase faster Internet service and everyone else continues to have slower service.
JOE	I do not want telecom giants and wealthy Internet companies to determine the future of the Internet.
JOE	I want new ideas to flourish on the Internet and not be blocked because they do not have sufficient funds to purchase fast service and compete.
JOE	I do not want the Internet to be turned into another vehicle that allows money to flow from working Americans to the wealthiest -- where web-based services like Netflix purchase faster service and pass the costs on to consumers.
JOE	The proposal being considered would kill rather than protect Net Neutrality and allow rampant discrimination online.
JOE	The Internet should be viewed as a public good and should be operated consistent with our rights to Freedom of Speech and Freedom of the Press.
JOE	Turning the Internet into a pay to play scheme is unacceptable.
JOE	-- Patty Call pmorlancall@att.net
JOE	I'll be blunt with you.
JOE	I want the FCC to enforce and guard net neutrality.
JOE	I don't want to see OUR Internet, the one which was originally built with OUR tax dollars, converted into a mere cash cow for Netflix, Disney, Clear Channel, and other major players.
JOE	I want *all* users of the Internet to have EQUAL access to all parts of it without having to pay extortionate fees.
JOE	I want ALL web entities, however small and seemingly insignificant, to have just as good a shot at acquiring an audience as a major entertainment outlet might.
JOE	In short, I want the Internet, not another form of cable TV.

JOE	Your job is to protect the majority, the average American, and so your reversal can only mean you or the FCC has become corrupted by money and influence from the Comcasts, Verizons, and AT&Ts of this country.

JOE	You have a decision in this, which is more than the rest of us have.
JOE	Thank you for your time, Breana Muckenthaler
JOE	Allowing a 'fast-track' on the internet for those with the money will only hamper our country.
JOE	This will force companies that can afford it to buy in so that they may stay competitive.
JOE	Those that can't afford it(Small business and startups) will have less of an opportunity to compete with the big players in the market.
JOE	This creates less competition and more of a domination or monopoly of the market.
JOE	Which is terrible for the consumer.
JOE	Not only that but the increased cost of the 'fast-track' WILL be passed directly on to the consumer in the way of higher prices.
JOE	Please don't sell the American people out to these few greedy companies!
JOE	Ian Armstrong 3373 Armada dr. #14 Ventura, CA 93003 US
JOE	I am horrified at the recent change in net neutrality.
JOE	The consumer will pay for this, and any company not paying the "toll" will be hurt.
JOE	There is no regulation or oversight on how slow these speeds are allowed to be for people not paying  the toll.
JOE	Effectively, it is killing any net neutrality, and I am scared at the prospect of what the internet will look like for  our children.
JOE	I know I don't have any actual sway, but please stop heading in this direction, lest we lose the free and open internet that gave up the innovation and progress I have seen through my lifetime.

JOE	We know what the media companies of the 1% want.
JOE	Indeed, everyone knows what they want: to create media cartels for the purpose of stifling competition; to charge more for ever-lousier service and quality; to make certain that the U.S. will fall further and further behind other nations in broadband access; and, most destructive of all, to ensure that Americans have access only to the values, ideas, and information that promote growing inequality in our nation.
JOE	In stark contrast we want freedom, opportunity, fair competition, a chance for small businesses to prosper, and fast, reliable access to broadband that's at least with sight of what citizens of competing nations enjoy.
JOE	And through all that, we want to see our nation encourage democratic rather than oligarchic values and practices.

JOE	I know that you used to work as a lobbyist for the cable companies, just as former FCC commissioner Meredith Baker went from being FCC commissioner to Senior VP of Comcast's Government Affairs.
JOE	I know you are likely being well paid, either directly or with a job offer sometime in the future, to favor the outcome the cable company\u2019s desire with regards to net neutrality.
JOE	By placing your personal interests ahead of the public's you are doing irrevocable harm to our nation.
JOE	For a nation that claims to be all about opportunity for the poor we will be rendered hypocrites, taking away the chance for people to start  up their own businesses online.
JOE	The internet will load so much more slowly for any site that isn't paying cable companies that consumers will be less likely to visit any site that isn't being paid for.
JOE	It is inconceivable that you believe  that ending net neutrality would be a positive change for anyone besides major corporations.
JOE	You are selling out the public good to line your pockets.
JOE	Once net neutrality is ended by the FCC, it will be nigh impossible to revisit the issue.
JOE	Your actions will have hugely negative repercussions for decades.
JOE	I doubt what I'm saying will have much impact on you, but you should be ashamed of what you are doing.
JOE	Thank you sir, Neil Milan -- This message transmitted on 100% recycled electrons.
JOE	Dear Tom, I recently read that the FCC plans to allow "fast lanes" within the internet, allowing internet providers to charge content makers and providers for access to the internet subscribers.
JOE	This is a gateway to destroying the freedom of the internet, and it is a very concerning thing to allow large corporate entities to control what was until now the ultimate vehicle for free market capitalism.
JOE	I know that you used to work as a lobbyist for the cable companies, just as former FCC commissioner Meredith Baker went from being FCC commissioner to Senior VP of Comcast's Government Affairs.
JOE	I believe that you are likely favoring the outcome the cable companies desire with regards to net neutrality due to previous biases.
JOE	By placing your personal beliefs ahead of the public's best interests, you are doing irrevocable harm to our nation.
JOE	For a nation that claims to be all about opportunity for the poor we will be rendered hypocrites, taking away the chance for people to start up their own businesses online.
JOE	The internet will stagnate as cable companies underhandedly force consumers content via unfair and noncompetitive pricing content tiers.
JOE	It is inconceivable that you believe that ending net neutrality would be a positive change for anyone besides major corporations.
JOE	Once net neutrality is ended by the FCC, it will be nigh impossible to revisit the issue.
JOE	Your actions will have hugely negative repercussions for decades.
JOE	I doubt what I'm saying will have much impact on you, but you should reconsider the consequences of what you are doing.
JOE	Thank you.

JOE	Dear FCC, I am writing to oppose rules that will allow for discrimination on the Internet - where the wealthy can purchase faster Internet service and everyone else continues to have slower service.
JOE	I do not want telecom giants and wealthy Internet companies to determine the future of the Internet.
JOE	I want new ideas to flourish on the Internet and not be blocked because they do not have sufficient funds to purchase fast service and compete.
JOE	I do not want the Internet to be turned into another vehicle that allows money to flow from working Americans to the wealthiest -- where web-based services like Netflix purchase faster service and pass the costs on to consumers.
JOE	The proposal being considered would kill rather than protect Net Neutrality and allow rampant discrimination online.
JOE	The Internet should be viewed as a public good and should be operated consistent with our rights to Freedom of Speech and Freedom of the Press.
JOE	Turning the Internet into a pay to play scheme is unacceptable.

JOE	All, As a daily user of the Internet for personal and business reasons I am greatly disturbed that you are on the verge of gutting any net neutrality left for the Internet by allowing large corporations who carry traffic through their network to charge content providers for preferential traffic treatment if the ISPs' discrimination is "commercially reasonable.\u201d I fully understand that many of you are in the \u201cpockets\u201d of these large corporations and do not really care about the average Internet user, but maybe some of you still have a conscious, and would like to keep the Internet open.
JOE	I urge you to not gut net neutrality further.
JOE	Regards, -- Christopher Wireman +1 303 521 4926
JOE	Today you have decided to allow utility companies to extort content providers into paying for bandwidth I have already paid for.
JOE	You have essentially allowed utilities to double-charge me for what is already some of the most expensive bandwidth in the world.
JOE	This is beyond absurd.
JOE	Let\u2019s imagine this was another industry, like an overnight parking lot.
JOE	The Comcast parking lot has 100 spaces, but they apparently have sold 1000 people the right to park in those spaces.
JOE	Rather than increase the size of their parking lot to match their claims of availability, or simply end the practice of selling products and services they cannot provide, they have decided to demand Ford pay them a tariff for every vehicle that Ford owners want to park in the parking lot.
JOE	If Ford does not pay, Comcast will make life miserable for the Ford owners, maybe put up road blocks and make them late to work every morning.
JOE	Obviously, if Ford gives in to this extortion, they will pass the cost along to Ford customers, essentially making Ford owners pay twice for that space in that parking lot, perhaps spreading the cost to Ford owners who don't park in that lot, a lot which still remains too small to support all the paying customers.
JOE	Oh, and did I mention that much of that parking lot was built with taxpayer money in the first place?
JOE	Ironically, the way your decision is being sold is that it will allow a \u201cfast lane.\u201d Of course, that \u201cfast lane\u201d is the lane I have now, you have simply allowed utilities to artificially slow down traffic and cripple services in order to extort more money out of content providers.
JOE	It\u2019s amazing how many countries on this planet have vastly superior Internet infrastructure without resorting to extortion and toll roads.
JOE	Perhaps you should study those countries before killing innovation on the Internet back home.
JOE	Please, reverse your decision to legalize this extortion.
JOE	To Tom Wheeler: Correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I know, the sole purpose of an Internet Service Provider is to provide internet service to consumers.
JOE	By allowing ISPs to discriminate against what sites can and cannot deliver content quickly, you are hurting the free market and destroying the ability for competition to rise.
JOE	Your misguided, monopolistic ideas are harmful to the economy and are unamerican, allowing pre-existing successful and wealthy companies to maintain power, while small businesses suffer.
JOE	If you think people will not fight this then you are seriously mistaken.
JOE	If the legacy you wish to leave behind is one of corruption, greed, and the destruction of something free, open, and just, then go ahead.
JOE	Otherwise you will reverse your decision.
JOE	I do not wish to grow old and reminisce about when the Internet was neutral.
JOE	Net neutrality affects this entire planet; what you are doing is despicable.

JOE	I do not want telecom giants and wealthy Internet companies to determine the future of the Internet.
JOE	I want new ideas to flourish on the Internet and not be blocked because they do not have sufficient funds to purchase fast service and compete.
JOE	I do not want the Internet to be turned into another vehicle that allows money to flow from working Americans to the wealthiest -- where web-based services like Netflix purchase faster service and pass the costs on to consumers.
JOE	The proposal being considered would kill rather than protect Net Neutrality and allow rampant discrimination online.
JOE	The Internet should be viewed as a public good and should be operated consistent with our rights to Freedom of Speech and Freedom of the Press.
JOE	Turning the Internet into a pay to play scheme is unacceptable.
JOE	-- Vanessa Lazaro Vcc75@yahoo.com
JOE	Your proposed rules destroy the democratic freedom of the internet.
JOE	Do not bow to the special interests.
JOE	Stand up for the  people!
JOE	Preserve net neutrality!

JOE	Dear mr. Wheeler, I'm a Dutch student of physics, and I, like many others whose e-mails you've probably received, like the internet.
JOE	I like the freedom, I like the free services, and I like the egalitarian structure.
JOE	Thankfully, the EU has voted to preserve it, but you are (according to reddit) responsible for destroying it in the US.
JOE	While my particular contribution may not be great, I statistically represent a significant portion of the tech-savvy population, and I am deciding never to lend my services to  the US, nor my employment to US companies.
JOE	You are harming your nation and the people within it, limiting their freedom and hurting them economically, through corruption or stupidity.

JOE	The FCC has the responsibility to preserve the Internet as we know it.
JOE	The Internet is, and should remain, a level playing field.
JOE	I pay Verizon for access to the Internet.
JOE	I shouldn't have to pay for better access to specific sites/services, and those sites/services shouldn't have to pay for me to get better access.
JOE	This stifles competition and allows big existing companies to become entrenched since they can pay the fees.
JOE	Where would the Internet (and the world economy) be if we made it harder for start-ups and new ideas to compete with the old standards?
JOE	I know you come from a background in the cable industry, but the Internet is not the right place to provide the tiered system we "enjoy" with television and mobile service.
JOE	I urge you to keep the Internet a free and equal place for business  and competition and back a platform of net neutrality.

JOE	Chairman Wheeler: I am writing to express frustration and disgust that your Commission failed to act in a manner responsive to the needs of  the American public when it recently provided guidance on its upcoming rules governing ISP handling of network traffic, as in this report: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/technology/fcc-new-net-neutrality-rules.html You have no doubt heard from consumers, companies, and your Commission's foreign counterparts a great deal about this issue.
JOE	Your forthcoming rulings that ISPs may prioritize traffic based on deals and contracts with content providers flies in the face of history and your foreign counterparts' experience.
JOE	While it may be difficult to classify ISPs as common carriers, establishing rules that explicitly promote network neutrality are _essential_ to a free and open exchange of content and ideas.
JOE	Network providers have indicated through their actions that they have little business incentive to expand network capacity even as they are not treated as common carriers.
JOE	Were I limited in the speed I could drive a car on the Interstate based on how much my car company had paid to the road's construction company, there would be outrage.
JOE	If the quality of my phone calls were based on how much the caller had paid to my phone company, there would be outrage.

JOE	It has been a safe guard  from exploitative governments, organization, businesses and people.

JOE	Andrew Canale (canale.6@osu.edu) writes: Hello Mr. Wheeler, Let me start by saying that I am a fellow Buckeye, and that I have exceptional experience with computers and networks,  as well as the abstract theories that underpin these complex networks.
JOE	I am sorry to have missed your recent visit to Ohio State.
JOE	I am disappointed to hear about your recent decisions/proposal(s) that would permit internet traffic categorization/prioritization/discrimination.
JOE	Such a multi-tiered system would damage the openness of the internet-- the same openness that has transformed the way that the world communicates.
JOE	I am firmly opposed to permitting Internet Service Providers from prioritizing traffic based on any form of payment or agreement.
JOE	Companies have already exercised their power to deny or permit interconnections based on differences between transit bandwidth (i.e.
JOE	Verizon, Comcast, Netflix).
JOE	And while I can understand the business case for that situation, I cannot support a policy whereby last-mile ISPs can charge for priority traffic to their subscribers.
JOE	Such a policy is a slippery slope to where I might be paying for 50Mbps internet, but only receive 2Mbps from a website that doesn't pay the 'toll' (even though there could be more than sufficient interconnection bandwidth).
JOE	Perhaps one of the most impactful examples may be in E-Learning.
JOE	What if Ohio State did not pay Time Warner Cable to prioritize traffic?
JOE	Then perhaps users in the USA and abroad would have videoconferencing bandwidth throttled.
JOE	There are too many examples and situations to think about, but I'll end on this note: Even if you continue with 'traffic prioritization', I would ask that it be implemented such that any 'high-priority' traffic be available over the top of a person's subscribed Internet Speed.
JOE	i.e.
JOE	if I pay for 2Mbps internet but my Netflix stream requires 7Mbps, it could be delivered as such, while not affecting the 2Mbps for the 'rest' of the internet.
JOE	Just a thought.

JOE	On the flip side, those companies that can afford these new charges from companies like Comcast will inevitably pass those charges on to the consumer.
JOE	So killing net neutrality both harms small businesses and consumers.

JOE	This is a gateway to destroying the freedom of the internet, and it is disgusting to allow large corporate  entities to control what was until now the ultimate vehicle for free market capitalism.
JOE	I know that you used to work as a lobbyist for the cable companies, just as former FCC commissioner Meredith Baker went from being FCC commissioner to Senior VP of Comcast's Government Affairs.
JOE	I know you are likely being well paid, either directly or with a job offer sometime in the future, to favor the outcome the cable companies desire with regards to net neutrality.
JOE	By placing your personal interests ahead of the public's you are doing irrevocable harm to our nation.
JOE	For a nation that claims to be all about opportunity for the poor we will be rendered hypocrites, taking away the chance for people to start  up their own businesses online.
JOE	The internet will load so much more slowly for any site that isn't paying cable companies that consumers will be less likely to visit any site that isn't being paid for.
JOE	It is inconceivable that you believe  that ending net neutrality would be a positive change for anyone besides major corporations.You<http://bl- 1.com/click/load/VGABOQFkWm4EZgdiVWY-b0231> are selling out the public good to line your pockets.
JOE	Once net neutrality is ended by the FCC, it will be nigh impossible to revisit the issue.
JOE	Your actions will have hugely negative repercussions for decades.
JOE	I doubt what I'm saying will have much impact on you, but you should be ashamed of what you are doing.

JOE	Researchers at Princeton University and Northwestern University compared the public\u2019s influence on 1,779 policy issues between 1981 and 2002, finding that more often than not, the interests of wealthy groups and individuals won out  over the demands of the general public.
JOE	For instance, when 80 percent of the public asked for a change of some sort, they got their way only about 43 percent of the time.

JOE	The Supreme Court has unleveled the playing field in it's so-called Citizen's United and other rulings.
JOE	Voter suppression continues.
JOE	The Transatlantic and Transpacific Trade Pacts, conducted in secrecy even from Congressional oversight, are set empower corporations to circumvent the power of both Congress and the Supreme Court to protect our  health, welfare, and powers of self-determination on both the local and national level.
JOE	Killing net neutrality further puts corporate interests ahead of the interests of our people.
JOE	And of our human habitat.
JOE	Take a walk in the woods.
JOE	Pray.
JOE	Check out Elizabeth Warren's new book "A Fighting Chance.
JOE	"  Meditate.
JOE	There's not much you can do about the Supreme Court rulings, voter suppression, or the Trade Pacts.
JOE	But you're pivotal to protecting Net Neutrality.

JOE	Jason Wallace (wallace21@gmail.com) writes: Chairman, the FCC's reversal of position on net neutrality is appalling.
JOE	I don't believe the spin, this opens the door for creating new internet speed tiers.
JOE	First is this fast lane, next will be a "cheaper" slow lane, even faster lanes, etc.
JOE	Frankly  I think the FCC is being cowardly by not taking the hard line stance on this.
JOE	As a technologist, I can see this having a real and negative impact on innovation.
JOE	Netflix is at the center of this issue and without net neutrality they would have had their legs cut from beneath them by the ISPs as they tried streaming content.
JOE	We would all still be mailing those silly red envelopes every day.
JOE	Don't disappoint the country, take a stand and do what's right for innovation.

JOE	In 2007, at a public forum at Coe College, in Iowa, Presidential candidate Barack Obama was asked about net neutrality.
JOE	Specifically, \u201cWould you make it a priority in your first year of office to reinstate net neutrality as the law of the land?
JOE	And would you pledge to only appoint F.C.C.
JOE	commissioners that support open Internet principles like net neutrality?\u201d \u201cThe answer is yes,\u201d Obama replied.
JOE	\u201cI am a strong supporter of net neutrality.\u201d Explaining, he said, \u201cWhat you\u2019ve been  seeing is some lobbying that says that the servers and the various portals through which you\u2019re getting information over  the Internet should be able to be gatekeepers and to charge different rates to different Web sites\u2026.
JOE	And that I think destroys one of the best things about the Internet\u2014which is that there is this incredible equality there.\u201d
JOE	I do not understand the about-face.
JOE	The United States is already in a position of more expensive internet for less speed, compared to European countries (I'm an American living in France, so I know).
JOE	Why - aside from the interests that lobby for greater profits for shareholders but yet do not provide excellence of service by first-world standards - would you make this decision?
JOE	Whether or not a court has ruled that the internet is not a utility for the public good, you know that it is, and should be regulated, just as utilities are, in the 21st century.
JOE	Those without access may not freeze to death, or have to live by candlelight, or die of thirst, but they will in every other way be fourth-class citizens, as our libraries, or free wi-fi in cities, will certainly be affected.
JOE	I am not only speaking of the inconveniences of slow streaming if one hasn't paid for a service.
JOE	It goes much deeper than that.
JOE	We want net neutrality.
JOE	Please reconsider your decision.
JOE	Nancy Maynes 19 rue du Petit Potet Dijon, MA 21000 FR
JOE	Dear FCC, I am writing to oppose rules that will allow for discrimination on the Internet - where the wealthy can purchase faster Internet service and everyone else continues to have slower service.
JOE	I do not want telecom giants and wealthy Internet companies to determine the future of the Internet.
JOE	I want new ideas to flourish on the Internet and not be blocked because they do not have sufficient funds to purchase fast service and compete.
JOE	I do not want the Internet to be turned into another vehicle that allows money to flow from working Americans to the wealthiest -- where web-based services like Netflix purchase faster service and pass the costs on to consumers.
JOE	The proposal being considered would kill rather than protect Net Neutrality and allow rampant discrimination online.
JOE	The Internet should be viewed as a public good and should be operated consistent with our rights to Freedom of Speech and Freedom of the Press.
JOE	Turning the Internet into a pay to play scheme is unacceptable.

JOE	Linda Walz 7717 Sunkist drive CA 94805
JOE	Mr. Wheeler, There have been leaks on the internet listed for purposed Net Neutrality rules.
JOE	These purposed rules leaks state that content providers should pay ISP providers for priority connections to their networks, this is not Net Neutrality (it also has nothing to do with the Netflix/Comcast deal as it is different).
JOE	Should these leaks be true, then it is obvious that the ideas of an open internet has been ignored by the federal government and that the internet as we know it has come to an end.
JOE	The idea of Net Neutrality is not blocking websites, but in insuring that no ISP degrades connections of providers who cannot pay while prioritizing the connections of those who can.
JOE	What is listed as being purposed is the exact opposite of Net Neutrality and should be stopped immediately.
JOE	If it is allowed I can no longer see an instance where the  general public can ever trust the decisions of the FCC ever again, as obviously, the FCC is listening to the ISPs far more than the general public.
JOE	Thank you for listening.

JOE	Travis Poppenhusen (qantravon@gmail.com) writes: Chairman Wheeler, I am extremely upset about the proposed plan to allow an internet "fast lane.
JOE	" Giving ISPs the power to charge content providers for faster access is a situation just waiting to be abused.
JOE	Already we see ISPs exploiting their customers for all they can.
JOE	As it stands, most Americans have little to no choice in which ISP to use, and the situation looks to be worsening.
JOE	Do you really believe that, given the opportunity, ISPs would choose to be fair and even in their distribution of information?
JOE	Allowing this kind of behavior will open the door for ISPs to discriminate against content providers in whatever manner  they like.
JOE	Even if a given content provider is willing to pay the "fast lane" fee, an ISP could choose to refuse service based on any number of criteria such as opposing political views, competing services, etc.
JOE	A "fast lane" would also drastically reduce the potential for innovation on the internet.
JOE	Many of the internet's biggest successes have started as extremely small ventures with very little funding.
JOE	Such small ventures will be unlikely to be able to afford an internet "fast lane," especially if they have to pay each ISP seperately.
JOE	Regardless of the terminology, what all of this boils down to is an effective monopoly on content by ISPs.
JOE	They will have complete control over what travels over their networks.
JOE	Please, do the right thing.
JOE	Do not enact these rules.
JOE	Find a way to ensure a free, open, and equal internet.
JOE	For everyone.

JOE	Dear FCC, I am writing to oppose rules that will allow for discrimination on the Internet - where the wealthy can purchase faster Internet service and everyone else continues to have slower service.
JOE	I do not want telecom giants and wealthy Internet companies to determine the future of the Internet.
JOE	I want new ideas to flourish on the Internet and not be blocked because they do not have sufficient funds to purchase fast service and compete.
JOE	I do not want the Internet to be turned into another vehicle that allows money to flow from working Americans to the wealthiest -- where web-based services like Netflix purchase faster service and pass the costs on to consumers.
JOE	The proposal being considered would kill rather than protect Net Neutrality and allow rampant discrimination online.
JOE	The Internet should be viewed as a public good and should be operated consistent with our rights to Freedom of Speech and Freedom of the Press.
JOE	Turning the Internet into a pay to play scheme is unacceptable.

JOE	Good Morning Tom, I was just sending you an email to express my concern regarding Net Neutrality.
JOE	I read about a recent case in which Comcast strong armed Netflix into paying the data transfer and this is concerning.
JOE	I do not think it is right to offer priority to companies that give in to this behavior.
JOE	I also do not like the influence that these large telecommunications companies have over politics and influencing different government divisions.
JOE	I find that the Comcast TWC merger to be  a blatant monopoly and should be struck down.
JOE	I hope that you value the American people enough to not cave to the people trying to turn a heavier profit by expanding their monopoly further and further entrenching themselves as the only solution.
JOE	Thank you for you time and I hop you strongly consider "We the People" in all of your decisions.
JOE	Thanks, Alex
JOE	I rely on the internet to get communication.
JOE	Allowing telcom providers to set different rates for different providers is only good for the telcom providers, NOT their customers.
JOE	This is a money grab and is NOT good for consumers.
JOE	It is  only good for them.
JOE	Who are you beholden to?

JOE	Now I am only 15, and I'm sure my grammar is atrocious, but please forgive me and if you can look past that, you may see a concerned youth who hopes a amazing thing doesn't die to greedy business men.
JOE	I'm also sure you hear something similar to that statement often but I truly believe that letting the government or large businesses take just a small thing from the online community would create repercussions unknown to this government.
JOE	Or maybe we as a community (the internet and all it's amazing people) would moan and groan for a month or two, maybe even a year.

JOE	Dear Commissioner Wheeler, Am writing to urge you to re-think your recent proposal to allow differing rates for corporations to purchase services from internet service providers-if enacted, on May 15, a process that will end a level playing field for all, in the future, on the internet.

JOE	Thank you for your serious consideration of this important matter.
JOE	Sincerely, Virginia Morris giniomorris@gmail.com
JOE	Hello Chairman Wheeler: I was extremely dismayed to read about the new plans to approve of "fast lanes" for the internet for various high profile content providers.
JOE	This kind of thinking goes completely against the concepts of net neutrality, no matter how it is advertised or packaged.
JOE	What WILL MOST CERTAINLY HAPPEN in the end if regulators capitulate is that the largest content providers will hog up the extreme majority of bandwidth, and lock out smaller content providers.
JOE	The FCC needs to stand up for EVERYONE, and not just the biggest corporate lobbyists with the biggest bank accounts.
JOE	The current course away from net neutrality is setting the stage for ever increasing corporate and government propaganda efforts with internet control.
JOE	That WILL MOST CERTAINLY OCCUR.
JOE	To think otherwise is merely fanciful dreaming.
JOE	The FCC needs to fully enforce net neutrality; and if they are somehow barred by the courts from doing so, then the FCC needs to stand up publicly to Congress and demand legislation requiring full net neutrality.
JOE	Sorry if this letter seems harsh; but I am tired of continual actions from Washington with all manner of endeavors that do a disservice to the people.

JOE	The Internet sure looks like a utility to me!
JOE	It delivers nameless bits from point to point -- not too different from electricity, water, sewage and natural gas.
JOE	Why treat it otherwise?
JOE	The neutrality of this utility is important to me, not just as a consumer but also as a citizen.
JOE	For an ISP to also be a content provider is a clear conflict of interest.
JOE	It would be far too easy for an ISP to favor its own  content, and even to suppress any content (e.g.
JOE	progressive activists) that it deems contrary to its business interests.
JOE	Businesses have a right to their business interests, but so do I, and theirs are not the same as mine.
JOE	Your job is to balance  them, erring on the side of the citizen-consumer.
JOE	This new rule is not balance.
JOE	For all these reasons, I want net neutrality.

JOE	Mr. Wheeler, I am a dental student and I am very concerned about how failure to pass the Net Neutrality measure could adversely affect my private and business interests in the future.
JOE	I hope you will make sure this measure is passed and effected and prevent Comcast from becoming an internet trust.
JOE	I am counting on you, Sir!

JOE	Please do not end it.

JOE	The internet has become integral to our daily lives.
JOE	We use the internet for most of our business transactions, our entertainment and communication.
JOE	The vital resource should be regulated under a principle of equal access to all.
JOE	Backing off on that principal creates a slippery slope to the concentration of power into the hands of a small number of already powerful corporations.
JOE	And it will deepen the divide between the classes.

JOE	Dear Tom, I recently read that the FCC plans to allow "fast lanes" within the internet, allowing certain companies to pay to receive additional speed.
JOE	This is a gateway to destroying the freedom of the internet, and it is disgusting to allow large corporate  entities to control what was until now the ultimate vehicle for free market capitalism.
JOE	I know that you used to work as a lobbyist for the cable companies, just as former FCC commissioner Meredith Baker went from being FCC commissioner to Senior VP of Comcast's Government Affairs.
JOE	I know you are likely being well paid, either directly or with a job offer sometime in the future, to favor the outcome the cable companies desire with regards to net neutrality.
JOE	By placing your personal interests ahead of the public's you are doing irrevocable harm to our nation.
JOE	For a nation that claims to be all about opportunity for the poor we will be rendered hypocrites, taking away the chance for people to start  up their own businesses online.
JOE	The internet will load so much more slowly for any site that isn't paying cable companies that consumers will be less likely to visit any site that isn't being paid for.
JOE	It is inconceivable that you believe  that ending net neutrality would be a positive change for anyone besides major corporations.You are selling out the public good to line your pockets.
JOE	Once net neutrality is ended by the FCC, it will be nigh impossible to revisit the issue.
JOE	Your actions will have hugely negative repercussions for decades.
JOE	I doubt what I'm saying will have much impact on you, but you should be ashamed of what you are doing.
JOE	Edit: Thanks for the gold.
JOE	Though I don't think that there's much chance that my email will have a substantial impact, I also don't want to be one of the ones who does nothing and later cries about how we let the good old days of online freedom pass by.
JOE	I want to try to fight, even if I can only fight money with words.
JOE	And who knows, if we give up before  even trying to fight then we'll never know if we could have been successful.
JOE	Regards
JOE	Hey buddy, Don't place your personal interests ahead of the public's.
JOE	Stand up for innovation and small businesses and support net neutrality.
JOE	Forbid companies from prioritizing internet content and bandwidth based on who greases their pockets!
JOE	To Mr. Wheeler, I urge you to preserve net neutrality, and with it one of the largest pillars of democracy in modern America.
JOE	There are so  many aspects of American life where money gives voice, gives a power over those without, that the poor are coming to find they have no control over the country they reside in.
JOE	Allowing monetary incentives to come into the world of web providers only serves to widen that gap, and will inject into the internet America's bias towards the powerful over bias towards the people.
JOE	Thank you for your time, Sean Fagan, Dallas TX

JOE	This topic should only be brought up in the context of it net neutrality existing.
JOE	Why can't you leave internet alone.
JOE	The internet is a magnificent place that should be nationwide and cheap.
JOE	It is a necessity of modern life because of its usefulness and benefits.
JOE	Why you would even think to take away that benefit or make it harder to obtain is beyond me.
JOE	This doesn't help the American people, this helps the well to do who have an idea of making more money of the people who already struggle.
JOE	Please make net neutrality a thing.
JOE	This is a plea, the internet can't be owned by the cable companies or regulated by them.
JOE	Dear Mr. Wheeler, I\u2019m writing today about the new rules about net neutrality that, per The Wall Street Journal, you are set to propose today  and vote over on May 15th.
JOE	As an American citizen, a higher education professional, and an avid proponent of free knowledge, I urge you to reconsider your position.
JOE	By allowing for any sort of privileged use of the internet\u2013and let\u2019s not kid ourselves, price stratification absolutely privileges access\u2013we are creating a system that further separates the poor from the rich.
JOE	When customers are gouged by an ISP in order to access Google (or any other site), we are necessarily supporting a system that dictates success based on your current financial status.
JOE	That\u2019s wrong, plain and simple.
JOE	Both cable companies and ISPs have already demonstrated their ability and desire to restrict content in a way that harms customers and benefits them financially, and the rules you propose are vague enough that ISPs will certainly take advantage of loopholes.
JOE	Beyond that, the wonderful thing about the internet is the way it drives innovation.
JOE	The reason we have Silicon Valley is because of a free and open Internet.
JOE	ISPs will force these companies to pay through the nose for high speed internet access, which will drive tech prices up, limit innovation, and encourage American companies to relocate overseas.
JOE	It goes without saying that this would spell disaster for our economy and the economic and financial welfare of many Americans.
JOE	I know that in some measure, your hands are tied by recent court cases that have struck down your other proposals for net neutrality.
JOE	Please, please don\u2019t cave to these pressures.
JOE	For the benefit of everyone, I encourage you to go back to the drawing board and reconsider your position.
JOE	I\u2019d like to propose a solution of my own: consider labeling ISPs as common carriers.
JOE	Under the FCC\u2019s current guidelines, that would give you regulatory power and, thus, allow you to preserve the net neutrality that is so integral to a modern democracy.
JOE	The United States has always been a global leader when it comes to citizens rights and the free exchange of ideas, and by compromising net neutrally in any way, we are setting a global standard that cannot be undone.
JOE	Thank you, Ashley Robinson
JOE	Dear FCC, I am writing to oppose rules that will allow for discrimination on the Internet - where the wealthy can purchase faster Internet service and everyone else continues to have slower service.
JOE	I do not want telecom giants and wealthy Internet companies to determine the future of the Internet.
JOE	I want new ideas to flourish on the Internet and not be blocked because they do not have sufficient funds to purchase fast service and compete.
JOE	I do not want the Internet to be turned into another vehicle that allows money to flow from working Americans to the wealthiest -- where web-based services like Netflix purchase faster service and pass the costs on to consumers.
JOE	The proposal being considered would kill rather than protect Net Neutrality and allow rampant discrimination online.
JOE	The Internet should be viewed as a public good and should be operated consistent with our rights to Freedom of Speech and Freedom of the Press.
JOE	Turning the Internet into a pay to play scheme is unacceptable.

JOE	Chairman Tom Wheeler and Commissioners of the FCC,       It is my firm belief and conviction that all internet traffic should be treated the same, unless in times of crisis to be slowed down for purposes of improving emergency services (medical, military, etc.
JOE	) capabilities in times of crisis.
JOE	(Much like the propositions for cell phone towers unused emergency spectrums)       In this modern day internet ownership, especially in the United States, should be a basic human right.
JOE	That the fees and contracts between ISPs and Consumers should not be conducted in bad faith by ISPs promising specific internet speeds, yet being able to throttle sites who do not pay them for access.
JOE	The consumer has paid for a specific service, but can still be taken advantage of since the ISP can choose which sites it will allows access to at what speeds.
JOE	I will not go into more detail or specifics because I am aware of my lack of expertise and greater depth of the issue, but believe my voice is heard by you and my arguments and fears have foundation      Thank you for time and consideration.

JOE	Dear Sir, I am deeply disappointed with the FCC's recent decision to abandon its commitment to net neutrality.
JOE	It is hard to see how this is in the interest of the American consumer.
JOE	As a matter of fact, it is hard to see how this is in the interest of anyone but Comcast and their army of lobbyists.
JOE	Your agency, under former chairman Michael Powell, was wrong to classify the internet as an "information service.
JOE	" That Mr. Powell is now representing a cable industry trade group, the chief beneficiaries of that decision, is troubling, to say the least.
JOE	The internet is not cable television.
JOE	Yes, people use the internet for entertainment.
JOE	But they also use it for practically everything nowadays, from paying their bills, to communicating with loved ones, to applying for jobs.
JOE	The internet should be reclassified as a utility to reflect that.
JOE	Americans already pay many times what Europeans pay for their internet for vastly inferior service.
JOE	Letting the established giants like Comcast dictate policy for the future of the internet will lead to ever-higher prices for consumers,  higher barriers for entry for entrepreneurs, and a kind of soft censorship, where independent voices are pushed further and further to the margins.
JOE	I urge you to think of the American consumer and entrepreneur and reclassify the internet as a "utility.
JOE	" Sincerely, Ash (A concerned citizen)

JOE	Net neutrality is a vital part of the open and vibrant Internet.
JOE	It has allowed startups such as Facebook and Google to deliver enormous value to the world.
JOE	Had they faced an internet where for example Rupert Murdoch's MySpace paid millions of dollars to ensure that only MySpace would load quickly on browsers, or Yahoo had paid millions to ensure that only its search service was fast, they would never have been able to succeed as they did.
JOE	And the successes of companies such as those in the past, and unknown others in the future, have been and will be only because they provide a BETTER product or experience.
JOE	Absent net neutrality, competition will also be absent, leading to monopoly domination and stagnation.

JOE	As you know the internet initially began as a military and university communications line.
JOE	As such, it was funded by the people of the United States.
JOE	The fact that corporations have seized the opportunity to build business around the use of the internet does not undo the fact that it was created as a public communications forum that individuals as well as businesses have incorporated into their lives.
JOE	I see the "information highway" as a important asset to the country (everyone), not just businesses.
JOE	Just as the interstate highway system is funded by the people and taxes, so should the "information highway".
JOE	I understand that some data speeds are critical to the success of a business, but why do they get to dominate the internet to their own advantage.

JOE	It's not too late for you to stand up for us, you know.
JOE	History is filled with men who chose to do good despite the hardships.
JOE	The best thing you can do for our country and it's citizens is to kill the fast lane and classify internet service providers as common carriers.

JOE	Dear Sirs & Madams I am extremely concerned about reports in The Wall Street Journal that the FCC will propose new open Internet rules this Thursday that will allow content companies to pay Internet service providers "for special access to consumers.
JOE	" I agree with Michael Weinberg at Public Knowledge who wrote: The FCC is inviting ISPs to pick winners and losers online.
JOE	The very essence of a "commercial reasonableness" standard is discrimination.
JOE	And the core of net neutrality is non discrimination.

JOE	April 24, 2014 Dear Chairman Wheeler: As an American citizen I am urging the FCC to avoid the proposal of new rules allowing companies like Google or Netflix to pay Internet service providers for special, faster lanes to send content to their customers.
JOE	Americans deserve an Internet that is free of toll roads, fast lanes and censorship.
JOE	Any FCC rules that allow ISPs to throttle Internet traffic will harm innovation and hurt consumers.
JOE	Internet service providers should be required to treat all data on the Internet equally, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, and modes of communication.
JOE	If these new rules are enacted, ISPs will likely create a tiered service model in order to control the Internet, remove competition, create artificial scarcity, and oblige subscribers to buy their otherwise uncompetitive services.
JOE	Net neutrality is vitally important for the preservation of current freedoms and should be enforced rather than weakened.
JOE	Thank you for your consideration.
JOE	Sincerely, Nathan Fortier

JOE	I did not personally write the following statements but they sum up my thoughts accurately.
JOE	--------------------- Dear Mr. Wheeler, With your reversal on Net Neutrality, it's unclear whether you deserve to lead the FCC.
JOE	Your job is to protect the majority, the average American, and so your reversal can only mean you or the FCC has become corrupted by money and influence from the Comcasts, Verizons, and AT&Ts of this country.
JOE	But it's not too late for you to stand up for us, you know.
JOE	History is filled with men who chose to do good despite the hardships.
JOE	You can kill the fast lane and classify internet service providers as common carriers like they should have been classified a decade ago.
JOE	You have the power to fix the errors of those who came before you.
JOE	Or you can obey the lobbyists, ride out the calls for your resignation from people you were chosen to protect, and history will not remember you.
JOE	You have a decision in this, which is more than the rest of us have.
JOE	--------------------- Thanks for reading, A concerned citizen.
JOE	Dear FCC, I am writing to oppose rules that will allow for discrimination on the Internet - where the wealthy can purchase faster Internet service and everyone else continues to have slower service.
JOE	I do not want telecom giants and wealthy Internet companies to determine the future of the Internet.
JOE	I want new ideas to flourish on the Internet and not be blocked because they do not have sufficient funds to purchase fast service and compete.
JOE	I do not want the Internet to be turned into another vehicle that allows money to flow from working Americans to the wealthiest -- where web-based services like Netflix purchase faster service and pass the costs on to consumers.
JOE	The proposal being considered would kill rather than protect Net Neutrality and allow rampant discrimination online.
JOE	The Internet should be viewed as a public good and should be operated consistent with our rights to Freedom of Speech and Freedom of the Press.
JOE	Turning the Internet into a pay to play scheme is unacceptable.

JOE	You said it yourself, Chairman Wheeler: "One of the great things about what the Internet does and why IT NEEDS TO STAY OPEN [my emphasis], it enables people to organize and express themselves.
JOE	" An open Internet also allows a level playing field for all businesses, large or small, where success or failure is determined solely by what a company has to offer.
JOE	If these proposed rules are adopted, untold numbers of small businesses with great ideas will not stand a chance of realizing their potential, simply because they can't afford the same access as large companies with larger budgets.
JOE	Stop pandering to big business by proposing rules that make it harder for smaller operations to compete!

JOE	Dear Mr. Wheeler, With your reversal on Net Neutrality, it's unclear whether you deserve to lead the FCC.
JOE	Your job is to protect the majority, the average American, and so your reversal can only mean you or the FCC has become corrupted by money and influence from the Comcasts, Verizons, and AT&Ts of this country.
JOE	But it's not too late for you to stand up for us, you know.
JOE	History is filled with men who chose to do good despite the hardships.
JOE	You can kill the fast lane and classify internet service providers as common carriers like they should have been classified a decade ago.
JOE	You have the power to fix the errors of those who came before you.
JOE	Or you can obey the lobbyists, ride out the calls for your resignation from people you were chosen to protect, and history will not remember you.

JOE	I was initially hopeful that you were truly going to represent the people based on your choice of words when you were selected as FCC chairman, but you are clearly a wolf in sheep's clothing.
JOE	I've learned that you have decided to completely gut net neutrality with your plans to allow for a fast line for internet access which content providers will be charged for.
JOE	Don't try to tell me that this is good for the consumer, or good for capitalism.
JOE	I'm not your average moron.
JOE	This increases the cost of entry for any new content providers wishing to enter the market.
JOE	As an "entrepreneur" I would think you understand this.
JOE	As a former lobbyist for the cable and wireless industry, I'm sure the dollars flowing your way are more important to you than we are.
JOE	ISP's are common utilities.
JOE	They provide no added value beyond content delivery, and do not enhance said content in any way.
JOE	Allowing for a fast line also creates an incentive to not continuously upgrade services on the slow lane.
JOE	The only parties that will benefit from this are those that you obviously represent.

JOE	Join the club, the folks who make products also dislike rumors and speculation in the press before announcements.
JOE	Your summary points skirt the actual issues, and only lead to further rumormongering.

JOE	The FCC must define what\u2019s relevant, or everything will be \u201cproprietary\u201d.

JOE	You see, being nothing more than plebs, we don't understand the finer points of politicking like you guys seem to.
JOE	We are very glad to have you around to make sure that even though a majority of Americans want net neutrality, the FCC disregards that and goes with the money.
JOE	I'm sure our new overlords (Comcast, Time Warner, Verizon, and ATT) will have only the best interests of the common man at heart and will not use their new found power in any way other than for mutual good.
JOE	Being American, you too will be lucky enough to witness these changes first hand and I hope you pat yourself on the back for leaving your children, and your children's children, with such a great legacy.
JOE	After all, the internet wasn't really  meant for the peasants anyway, and ISP companies definitely aren't "common carriers" and shouldn't be regulated as such.

JOE	Is this supposed to be a joke?
JOE	Some historical perspective<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2005/06/27/AR2005062700415.html>: Back in the early 2000s the ISP market got destroyed.
JOE	The cable and phone companies were allowed to ban all competing ISPs from offering services on their lines.
JOE	Everybody said "they're going to abuse their new government-granted monopoly.
JOE	"    A key concern is that phone and cable companies could potentially use their power over the network to act as gatekeepers of the Internet, discriminating and limiting consumers' access to certain services so that some Web sites and  online services are favored.
JOE	Opponents of yesterday's ruling said they would push the FCC and Capitol Hill to codify rules ensuring the "network neutrality" on the Internet.
JOE	"The ballgame becomes now how each of the two industries that controls a wire can determine what content, what access, at what speed consumers and technologists can offer and retrieve services over those networks," said Gene Kimmelman, senior director of Consumers Union.
JOE	And here we are.

JOE	People from all over the world  are now able connect with each other in a way never before possible.
JOE	People can become more informed.
JOE	People can create businesses and new lives for themselves because of the Internet.
JOE	The Internet is one of America's, if not the world's, last truly free markets.
JOE	A person doesn't need to have a huge investor  or a ton of money to get started.
JOE	Almost anybody can create a business and be successful if their product truly is the best out there.
JOE	Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are all well known for their small beginnings turning into great success.
JOE	The new Internet rules that are about to be proposed would kill those possibilities.
JOE	Allowing ISPs to charge content providers either more or less money not only creates preferential treatment for large content providers (who can afford to pay whatever the ISPs decide they want to charge), but also discriminates against content providers who don't have the money to appease the ISPs.
JOE	I know I'm not the only one who feels this way.

JOE	Net neutrality means treating all data on the internet equally, with no discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, and modes of communication.
JOE	It does not mean whatever delusional definition you assigned to it.
JOE	Now that we've cleared that up, let me remind you of the FCCs goals, as listed on your own website: * Promoting competition, innovation and investment in broadband services and facilities * Supporting the nation's economy by ensuring an appropriate competitive framework for the unfolding of the communications revolution * Encouraging the highest and best use of spectrum domestically and internationally * Revising media regulations so that new technologies flourish alongside diversity and localism * Providing leadership in strengthening the defense of the nation's communications infrastructure In absolutely no way would your proposal help reach these goals.
JOE	You are in fact cementing the monopolies, that you should have already taken the steps to dismantle, in their position of exploiting consumers.
JOE	With competition, there is usually other companies.
JOE	I see no other companies.
JOE	So when they throttle us, who are we supposed to go to for this supposed "competition"?
JOE	When they begin to charge high-bandwidth services for exclusive access or these "fast lanes", where is the competition they can go to for competitive prices?
JOE	The FCC itself, in 2010, in regards to their rules for Open Internet, stated: "For a number of reasons, including those discussed above in Part II.B, a commercial arrangement between a broadband  provider and a third party to directly or indirectly favor some traffic over other traffic in the broadband Internet access service connection to a subscriber of the broadband provider (i.e., \u201cpay for priority\u201d) would raise significant cause for concern.
JOE	" (FCC, 2010, Sec.
JOE	76) This is the very year, and very rule you claim to be looking at for support in your blog post for your proposal, i.e.
JOE	"The Notice does not change the underlying goals of transparency, no blocking of lawful content, and no unreasonable discrimination among users established by the 2010 Rule".
JOE	Your proposal disgusts me, and you should be ashamed of it.
JOE	You have clearly placed your own interests above that of the people you serve, and it is simply appalling.

JOE	Dear FCC, I am writing to oppose rules that will allow for discrimination on the Internet - where the wealthy can purchase faster Internet service and everyone else continues to have slower service.
JOE	I do not want telecom giants and wealthy Internet companies to determine the future of the Internet.
JOE	I want new ideas to flourish on the Internet and not be blocked because they do not have sufficient funds to purchase fast service and compete.
JOE	I do not want the Internet to be turned into another vehicle that allows money to flow from working Americans to the wealthiest -- where web-based services like Netflix purchase faster service and pass the costs on to consumers.
JOE	The proposal being considered would kill rather than protect Net Neutrality and allow rampant discrimination online.

JOE	Chairman Tom Wheeler and Commissioners of the FCC,       It is my firm belief and conviction that all internet traffic should be treated the same, unless in times of crisis to be slowed down for purposes of improving emergency services (medical, military, etc.
JOE	) capabilities in times of crisis.
JOE	(Much like the propositions for cell phone towers unused emergency spectrums)       In this modern day internet ownership, especially in the United States, should be a basic human right.
JOE	That the fees and contracts between ISPs and Consumers should not be conducted in bad faith by ISPs promising specific internet speeds, yet being able to throttle sites who do not pay them for access.
JOE	The consumer has paid for a specific service, but can still be taken advantage of since the ISP can choose which sites it will allows access to at what speeds.
JOE	I will not go into more detail or specifics because I am aware of my lack of expertise and greater depth of the issue, but believe my voice is heard by you and my arguments and fears have foundation and a healthy point.
JOE	Thank you for time and consideration.
JOE	Respectfully, Garrett T Gile Marquette University Biomedical Science 14\u2019
JOE	Mr. Wheeler, I'll make this brief.
JOE	The internet, in the year 2014, is analogous to the delivery of water, electricity, and gas to one's home: it's a utility and should be treated as such.
JOE	Do what the FCC failed to do years ago and classify ISPs as common carriers.
JOE	As a very small business owner, I depend on net neutrality to both receive and deliver content.
JOE	As a citizen, I expect net  neutrality to allow equal ability for all to exchange information, not "more equal" for some.
JOE	A few months ago you received a petition with a million signatures in support of net neutrality.
JOE	The public wish and the  public good require the reality of net neutrality, not just nice words about it.
JOE	Please serve the public good ahead of the wishes of moneyed special interests.
JOE	Your job is to make and maintain rules that serve the public, above the industry for which the rules apply.
JOE	I urge you in the strongest possible terms not to end or even weaken net neutrality, but to maintain and protect it.
JOE	Sincerely, Andrew Rubel 107 Yorktown St Somerville, MA 02144 US

JOE	Ending net neutrality - which brought us the Internet we have today, and the technology that powers it - is most assuredly NOT the right thing for the people.
JOE	Your proposed rules are the sort of thing I'd expect from a GW Bush appointee - heavily favoring (some) business interests over the good of the people and small businesses.

JOE	Don't ruin everything for everyone ever.
JOE	Dear Tom, Please don't ruin the internet by destroying network neutrality.
JOE	Sincerely, Someone who uses the internet a lot.
JOE	Mr. Wheeler, I am writing to express my concern regarding the proposed FCC Open Internet Rules.
JOE	I read about the Wall Street Journal piece yesterday and then read your response on the FCC blog today.
JOE	However, I am still concerned.
JOE	To be clear, do the proposed rules mean that ISPs may act in a commerically reasonable manner in charging tariffs for preferred traffic?
JOE	The language to avoid harming the internet, by harming competition or consumers seems vague.
JOE	Specifically, I could imagine ISPs arguing that better quality of service or faster transmission is a benefit to consumers, even if the tariff results in a higher cost of service to the consumer.
JOE	They could also argue that charging such tariffs does  not harm competition because all service providers have equal opportunity to pay the tariff.
JOE	In the past few weeks, we've seen Comcast and others request payment for preferential treatment from Netflix and within a very short time Netflix announced a price hike for new consumers.
JOE	The proposed rules would not prevent this from happening for any other service or from this happening again to Netflix users.
JOE	I recently read an example from the FCC of the benefit of the proposed rules.
JOE	"After all, a prioritized connection for a heart monitor may be a good thing at home without harming anyone else.
JOE	" However, even this positive example falls apart quickly because traffic prioritization for any service means some level of discrimination for everyone else-- meaning a non-open internet.
JOE	I appreciate and welcome steps to preserve an open internet, but I do not believe that the proposed rules will achieve this.
JOE	To the contrary, it seems likely they will solidify the opposite effect.
JOE	Why not classify ISPs as a utility--I understand that may be a difficult stance to take, but the effect of such classification seems to be what you're really trying to get at anyway?
JOE	Thank you for taking the time to consider my concerns.
JOE	Best regards, Randy Braegger
JOE	Dear Mr Wheeler, I believe the legislation you are proposing will allow IPS's to give preferential treatment to sites and services who can afford it and not to others.
JOE	The internet is a utility, and access should be as universal as the right to education and the right to social services.
JOE	The internet is a utility.

JOE	Mr. Wheeler, There is probably nothing I can say or do to make you reconsider your plans of killing off one of the founding principles  of the Internet, the Net Neutrality.
JOE	The principle, whereby all content is created equal and is delivered at equal speed, sans the content server(s) hosting capacity.
JOE	This simple yet effective arrangement had ensured fair free trade environment whereby content providers paid for costs of hosting and delivery of content, while content consumers paid for delivery of content as well.
JOE	Most importantly, such content delivery equality allowed for Internet to flourish as a medium of content exchange, where popularity of content was simply a function of content originality and/or quality.
JOE	Now, communications monopolies are changing all of that.
JOE	Instead of profiting from competing on speed of delivery or their network capacity, these cartels are demanding a double rent from the same amount of content moving through their  pipes.
JOE	When some content is delivered faster, it's already an unfair practice in the egalitarian world of the Internet.
JOE	Not only would it lead to a sub par quality of "basic" service, but it would also unfairly promote "faster" content as well as "faster" content publishers.
JOE	It would also introduce additional costs in the start-up community business model.
JOE	In addition to the already existing costs of content creation, hosting and bandwidth you are introducing "fast access" cost, which is currently inherent in all of the already existing ISP services contracts.
JOE	ISPs are simple utilities, they do not enhance content or provide any value add beyond delivering it to consumers.
JOE	By allowing this double dipping practices you are placing a lot of entrepreneurs unable to pay additional "fast access" cost at a great disadvantage.
JOE	You are also changing the already existing fabric of the Internet, while supporting another power grab on behalf of monopolistic enterprises that should be broken apart, not granted another carte blanche.
JOE	Many of us in the Internet community realize that you are doing this not because you are unfamiliar with the subject at hand, but because you are an important part of the pyramid of monopolistic power, an agent of consolidation.
JOE	You are the gate keeper, the Chairman of a government agency who is already paid to represent "we the people".
JOE	Not unlike ISPs  which you seem to represent instead, you are clearly seen as someone collecting the rent from these monopolies, in exchange for the rights of the people.
JOE	How effective would Abraham Lincoln be if he had to pay double or triple for his wartime telegrams, because they were "urgent" in nature?
JOE	You should know, you wrote a book about it.
JOE	You were also a  venture capitalist once, helping peer to peer start-ups become viable businesses, which is admirable.
JOE	At that point you should realize just how damaging these "fast access" costs would be to any Internet entrepreneur.
JOE	We can only hope you are able to muster any remnants of your common sense and entrepreneurial good will and do the right thing, namely recognize the obvious fact that ISPs are simple utilities and preserve the Net Neutrality.

JOE	Dear Tom, I recently read that the FCC plans to allow "fast lanes" within the internet, allowing certain companies to pay to receive additional speed.
JOE	This is a gateway to destroying the freedom of the internet, and it is disgusting to allow large corporate  entities to control what was until now the ultimate vehicle for free market capitalism.
JOE	I know that you used to work as a lobbyist for the cable companies, just as former FCC commissioner Meredith Baker went from being FCC commissioner to Senior VP of Comcast's Government Affairs.
JOE	I know you are likely being well paid, either directly or with a job offer sometime in the future, to favor the outcome the cable companies desire with regards to net neutrality.
JOE	By placing your personal interests ahead of the public's you are doing irreversible harm to our nation.
JOE	For a nation that claims to be all about opportunity for all, we will be rendered hypocrites, taking away the chance for people to start up their own businesses online.
JOE	The internet will load so much more slowly for any site that isn't paying cable companies that consumers will be less likely to visit any site that isn't being paid for.
JOE	Companies already established in the market will be able to offer monetary and advertising incentives to the providers to slow the speed of their competitors, even if those competitors are also paying (albeit a lesser amount).
JOE	It is inconceivable that you believe that ending net neutrality would be a positive change for anyone besides major corporations.You are selling out the public good to line your pockets.

JOE	(No, this email's not real, it's http://deadfake.com) Dear Mr. Wheeler, With your reversal on Net Neutrality, it's unclear whether you deserve to lead the FCC.
JOE	Your job is to protect the majority, the average American, and so your reversal can only mean you or the FCC has become corrupted by money and influence from the Comcasts, Verizons, and AT&Ts of this country.
JOE	But it's not too late for you to stand up for us, you know.
JOE	History is filled with men who chose to do good despite the hardships.
JOE	You can kill the fast lane and classify internet service providers as common carriers like they should have been classified a decade ago.
JOE	You have the power to fix the errors of those who came before you.

JOE	You have a decision in this, which is more than the rest of us have.

JOE	Please don't abandon net neutrality.
JOE	I realize this is a fantastic way for very rich people to become even richer, but it is as the cost of simple users like me and my family.
JOE	The freedom of information (which has it's roots in the First Amendment to the Constitution) is of paramount importance to a society that values truth and knowledge, putting a price tag on information is of paramount importance to those who wish to charge us for that information, and even worse, control it.
JOE	Please please PLEASE, don't do this.
JOE	I cannot speak to your motivations as we have never met, and while there is plenty  of speculation (unfortunate words like "corruption" and "plutocracy" get thrown around, accusation words for which I have little use without proof) I wish to appeal to your humanity.

JOE	Stephen Roberts CA 92037 US
JOE	Mr. Chairman, I am writing to express my extreme disappointment and disapproval of your proposal allowing for Internet providers to establish fast lanes for those who choose to pay for them.
JOE	I believe this is a fundamental and unacceptable compromise on President Obama's campaign pledge to uphold Net Neutrality.
JOE	Taken within the context of Comcast's proposed merger with Time-Warner Cable, the prospects of allowing a service provider to accept money from content providers for faster delivery are frightening.
JOE	One company, Comcast, would effectively be in charge of what Internet content a large swath of Americans get to see.
JOE	They would almost certainly give favorable treatment to the content companies which they own.
JOE	And if a competing, smaller content provider came along, Comcast doesn't have to directly throttle that provider to protect their businesses.
JOE	They can simply make the fast lane that much faster -- enabling their preferred partners to stream (for example) HD video, while relegating smaller startup to SD video, making their content less attractive to customers unless they pay Comcast's tariffs, which they may not be able to afford.
JOE	I know that your proposed rules have some manner of guarantee for minimum quality-of-service and would require that Internet providers make this new fast lane available to "anyone" under "commercially reasonable" terms.
JOE	I am sure these  rules were added to mitigate exactly the scenario I described above.
JOE	But to be perfectly honest, I have little faith that the  FCC can enforce definitions of "commercially reasonable" that benefit American broadband customers in a court of law.
JOE	There is enough wiggle room in that phrase that I'm sure Comcast could just start doing something that is without question harmful to American broadband customers and then tie the FCC up in court for years (all while continuing whatever damaging practices they come up with).
JOE	And there's no guarantee that such a fight would even go the FCC's way.
JOE	In fact, history indicates that it would not.
JOE	These rules may not allow for a "slow lane" today where Internet providers can actively discriminate against traffic they  don't like.
JOE	But with these rules in place to establish precedent for Internet traffic discrimination, you would be naive to not expect there to be such a thing in 5 years.
JOE	Please reconsider this proposal.
JOE	I believe that it is un-American, and I cannot see how it could possibly benefit the average American citizen.
JOE	-- Damien Sorresso
JOE	O.K.
JOE	Mr. Wheeler, I've got a theory.
JOE	About why you're lobbying for this.
JOE	They're paying you, I'd assume.
JOE	the companies  that'd be buying the faster plateaus of access.
JOE	Money's great, isn't it?
JOE	a new house, a new car, power in general, it's all attainable with money.
JOE	I get it.
JOE	But really, you're lobbying for THIS?
JOE	To destroy the last bastion of true free speech and equal opportunity?
JOE	Come on, can't you make money some other way?
JOE	Without making millions of people angry?
JOE	I think  you know that this is a ridiculous proposal, and you know what it'll do to the general free spirit of the internet.
JOE	Why can't you be like all the other politicians and take bribes from oil companies or something?
JOE	There are plenty of opportunities to make money.
JOE	this is America, isn't it?
JOE	You're involved in politics, so you're patriotic, yeah?
JOE	Then really,  stop assaulting free speech in the name of a few bucks that won't matter when you're dead in what, fifteen, twenty years  or so.
JOE	It's un-American.

JOE	Please don't make it worse for the average American, things are already bad enough down here.
JOE	I am the owner of a small business that supplies software and data services.
JOE	I cannot afford to pay extra to access my data in the cloud.
JOE	My business costs are already inhibiting my viability.
JOE	If internet service providers are allowed to give preferential service to some customers and punitive treatment to others, it will put small businesses like mine OUT of business and AGAIN give the advantage to large companies and reduce competition in the marketplace.
JOE	I strongly urge you to PRESERVE NET NEUTRALITY.

JOE	Dear Tom, I recently read that the FCC plans to allow "fast lanes" within the internet, allowing certain companies to pay to receive additional speed.
JOE	This is a gateway to destroying the freedom of the internet, and it is disgusting to allow large corporate  entities to control what was until now the ultimate vehicle for free market capitalism.
JOE	I know that you used to work as a lobbyist for the cable companies, just as former FCC commissioner Meredith Baker went from being FCC commissioner to Senior VP of Comcast's Government Affairs.
JOE	I know you are likely being well paid, either directly or with a job offer sometime in the future, to favor the outcome the cable companies desire with regards to net neutrality.
JOE	By placing your personal interests ahead of the public's you are doing irrevocable harm to our nation.
JOE	For a nation that claims to be all about opportunity for the poor we will be rendered hypocrites, taking away the chance for people to start  up their own businesses online.
JOE	The internet will load so much more slowly for any site that isn't paying cable companies that consumers will be less likely to visit any site that isn't being paid for.

JOE	Dear Mr. Wheeler, I\u2019m writing you today because of a Wall Street Journal report that indicates the FCC will be changing its stance on net neutrality.
JOE	The Internet should be a free and open space.
JOE	Cable companies should handle all traffic equally.
JOE	The idea that Comcast or AT&T or Time Warner can sell priority bandwidth to a larger company is against what net  is and should be.
JOE	I can understand Mr. Wheeler from what I\u2019ve read  that you are still lobbying for the CITA or these changes that you propose would have never seen the light of day.
JOE	The changes that you do propose will hinder startups like Twitter and Facebook, and give priority bandwidth to larger companies.
JOE	This is not how the Internet was designed.
JOE	I know the proposed rules have not been released yet, but I can assure you I will be writing during the comment period to make sure the Internet stays open for everyone.
JOE	Ted Ellis chiefTed@Gmail.com
JOE	Dear FCC, I am writing to oppose rules that will allow for discrimination on the Internet - where the wealthy can purchase faster Internet service and everyone else continues to have slower service.
JOE	I do not want telecom giants and wealthy Internet companies to determine the future of the Internet.
JOE	I want new ideas to flourish on the Internet and not be blocked because they do not have sufficient funds to purchase fast service and compete.
JOE	I do not want the Internet to be turned into another vehicle that allows money to flow from working Americans to the wealthiest -- where web-based services like Netflix purchase faster service and pass the costs on to consumers.
JOE	The proposal being considered would kill rather than protect Net Neutrality and allow rampant discrimination online.
JOE	The Internet should be viewed as a public good and should be operated consistent with our rights to Freedom of Speech and Freedom of the Press.
JOE	Turning the Internet into a pay to play scheme is unacceptable.

JOE	Dear Mr Wheeler, I am writing you today as a taxpaying citizen who is highly concerned about how the FCC is regulating the internet.
JOE	I have only two simple points that I would like to communicate to you: #1 The internet is a utility and should be regulated accordingly.
JOE	My wife and I work from home and both of us depend on the internet to earn a living.
JOE	The internet is essential to our livelihood.
JOE	This is the case for most Americans.
JOE	I would implore you to stop playing the lobbyist game of negotiation and attack this problem from the source.
JOE	This means regulating the internet as a utility.
JOE	#2 There can be no ISP "fast lane" allowed.
JOE	This is a point of no compromise.
JOE	We cannot allow ISP's to dictate content delivery in this matter.
JOE	It opens up the door to eroding the free speech of the internet.
JOE	It might not happen today or tomorrow but in 10 years the level of complexity that this concession would create would be staggering and almost impossible for the FCC to regulate fairly.
JOE	In closing we live in exciting times during a technological transformation that will be looked back on as an important era in American history.
JOE	You sir have the power to write that history.
JOE	I implore you to take a stand against large and corrupt corporations who do not care about the people they service.
JOE	These companies will never do what is right for the consumer because their competition is non-existent.
JOE	It is up to the FCC to protect Americans from these parasites.

JOE	Dear Mr. Wheeler, I am writing to express my extreme displeasure over the new proposed rules for internet providers, which would allow the creation of internet 'fast lanes' for those able to pay for it.
JOE	Whether or not this change is considered an overhaul of 'net neutrality' is semantic.

JOE	By placing your personal interests ahead of the public's you are doing irrevocable harm to our nation.
JOE	For a nation that claims to be all about opportunity for the poor we will be rendered hypocrites, taking away the chance for people to start  up their own businesses online.
JOE	The internet will load so much more slowly for any site that isn't paying cable companies that consumers will be less likely to visit any site that isn't being paid for.
JOE	It is inconceivable that you believe  that ending net neutrality would be a positive change for anyone besides major corporations.You are selling out the public good to line your pockets.
JOE	Once net neutrality is ended by the FCC, it will be nigh impossible to revisit the issue.
JOE	Your actions will have hugely negative repercussions for decades.
JOE	I doubt what I'm saying will have much impact on you, but you should be ashamed of what you are doing.

JOE	I thought that you and other agents of the government would do the right thing for the PEOPLE of this nation, and reign in the control that ISPs have on an essential piece of infrastructure.
JOE	If anything, I was hoping that you would push Net Neutrality to new, more equal grounds.
JOE	As it stands, the ISPs in this nation are completely gouging Americans in terms of price/performance.
JOE	In Europe, an internet package that would cost  70 USD can be had for the equivalent of 30 USD - I ask you, Mr. Chairman, how is this in the interest of the PEOPLE.
JOE	It completely baffles me.
JOE	I implore you to listen to the people of this nation and retract your ridiculous proposal that has made a mockery of your so-called "Net Neutrality".
JOE	If anything, these new rules will encourage ISPs like Comcast and TWC to charge even more  for service while offering similar or worse performance.
JOE	I simply cannot fathom how your proposed rules will help our  country develop further and faster and how this will help the citizens of this great nation.
JOE	The only "people" I see this benefiting are corporations - namely ISPs who will have an expansive new source of cash flow - that will be able to line their pockets even more than they already have been.
JOE	TL;DR:  Mr. Wheeler, if you approve and enact these new rules, you will fuck up the future of the Internet.
JOE	In the age of information, the Internet is the greatest resource we have to develop further as a country, and as human beings.
JOE	Please don't bring the future of the Internet to its knees just so a few corporations can make profits off of it.

JOE	Dear Mr Wheeler, Please keep the internet free and accessible.
JOE	The rules you have proposed would make a system where only large, wealthy companies would be able to reach consumers.
JOE	The huge economic and employment benefits we have seen from the internet are the result of a free and neutral internet.

JOE	To whom it may concern, I am a registered voter in center country, PA, who is concerned about newly proposed regulations in the area of the open  internet policy.
JOE	Specifically, any clauses which pertain to allowing ISP's to negotiate for preferential traffic treatment based on the principle of what is "commercial reasonable.
JOE	" I am concerned that this will compromise the high degree of Internet neutrality we have cultivated up to this point in history and cause growing gaps in the services which lower income individuals are able access.
JOE	I will be watching the issue, and I hope the FCC will do its best to work in the best interest of the general constituency of American voters.
JOE	Be well, Jonathan Bojan State College, PA, 16801
JOE	Dear Mr. Wheeler, I am writing to express that the FCC's proposed new rules for Internet 'fast lanes' are anti-consumer and anti- competitive.
JOE	One of the most important factors which has led to the tremendous amount of tech innovation we've seen in the last 2 decades is that all traffic on the Internet is treated equally; if you produce a compelling app, anyone and everyone can use it, and natural market pressures decide who succeeds and who fails.
JOE	With these new proposed rules, a startup - who is likely to be short of funding anyway - would need to secure additional funding to immediately cut a deal  with an ISP or their app would be at risk of never reaching an audience.
JOE	These deals also provide incentives for ISPs to take sides on applications.
JOE	If an ISP and an application have an agreement, it is in the ISP's interest for that application to succeed.
JOE	As a result, it makes it very, very difficult for a new product to overtake an old one - if, say, AT&T has a deal cut with Facebook to provide 'fast lane' access, there's no incentive for AT&T to make a deal with any similar product.
JOE	This leads to another negative consequence - that ISPs are  each going to make deals with only some popular sites.
JOE	For example, it could be that if you want fast Netflix and Facebook access, you have to use Comcast, but if you want fast Google and Twitter access, they only have deals with AT&T.
JOE	You use all 4 sites?
JOE	Too bad.
JOE	Additionally, it incentivizes ISPs to artifically introduce congestion.
JOE	If non-paid traffic is being served at adequate speeds, why would anyone pay for the 'fast lanes'?
JOE	It's in the ISPs' financial interest to create congestion - or at least minimize network expansion - so that there's motivation for business to pay for the 'fast lanes'.
JOE	We need the exact opposite of this - a system which encourages ISPs to provide faster, more reliable Internet service for all.
JOE	I strongly encourage you to rethink these proposed rules.
JOE	They would compromise consumer choice, repress technical innovation, and incentivize artificial congestion with the sole benefit of bringing in profits for ISPs.
JOE	-Scott Callaghan
JOE	Dear FCC, I am writing to oppose rules that will allow for discrimination on the Internet - where the wealthy can purchase faster Internet service and everyone else continues to have slower service.
JOE	I do not want telecom giants and wealthy Internet companies to determine the future of the Internet.
JOE	I want new ideas to flourish on the Internet and not be blocked because they do not have sufficient funds to purchase fast service and compete.
JOE	I do not want the Internet to be turned into another vehicle that allows money to flow from working Americans to the wealthiest -- where web-based services like Netflix purchase faster service and pass the costs on to consumers.
JOE	The proposal being considered would kill rather than protect Net Neutrality and allow rampant discrimination online.
JOE	The Internet should be viewed as a public good and should be operated consistent with our rights to Freedom of Speech and Freedom of the Press.
JOE	Turning the Internet into a pay to play scheme is unacceptable.

JOE	If you want to change that image in any way, you'll reject Tom Wheeler's insane proposal to pick winners and  losers over the internet by allowing those with the cash to buy rights to internet traffic.
JOE	Make no mistake, you will destroy the Internet if you pass his proposal.
JOE	You will doom innovative startups who do not have the cash to compete against deep-pocketed multinationals.
JOE	You give unfair advantage to those who need it the least, and you doom the American public to an aging telecommunications infrastructure already less competitive than many nations with only a fraction of our annual GDP.

JOE	As I understand it, 10 gigs of data from google should cost google on the upload and me on the download, but why should that same 10 gigs cost something different from another source?
JOE	It seems like this would give all the power to the ISPs.

JOE	But while this new set of rules might allow you to fine any flagrant violators--any company that deigns to outright block  traffic "just 'cuz" with no good reason, this new set of rules will also effectively enshrine and act as an endorsement of a  very non-neutral Internet where big companies are totally allowed *in writing* to make traffic they don't like really, really slow.
JOE	I wonder--does the language specify *how* slow companies are allowed to make the traffic?

JOE	Imagine if a call to a family member on another telco service cost 20x more, because the telco could and wanted to incentivize people to use their service over another\u2026 That\u2019s the precipice we find ourselves on now.
JOE	You and the FCC stand ready to change the future for the better or the worst.
JOE	It\u2019s already starting, with Netflix having to pay comcast for usable throughput.
JOE	What happens when i can\u2019t access the website for my local representative, because she opposes a bill my internet provider is in favor of?
JOE	What happens when I can\u2019t reach the website of another internet provider because they compete with mine?
JOE	A few years ago, I\u2019d have said those examples are farfetched, but now\u2026 not even remotely farfetched.
JOE	We\u2019re months, maybe years from that reality, and the FCC is the only line of defense the citizens have against this future.

JOE	Dear Tom, I recently read that the FCC plans to allow "fast lanes" within the internet, allowing certain companies to pay to receive additional speed.
JOE	This is a gateway to destroying the freedom of the internet, and it is disgusting to allow large corporate  entities to control what was until now the ultimate vehicle for free market capitalism.
JOE	I know that you used to work as a lobbyist for the cable companies, just as former FCC commissioner Meredith Baker went from being FCC commissioner to Senior VP of Comcast's Government Affairs.
JOE	I know you are likely being well paid, either directly or with a job offer sometime in the future, to favor the outcome the cable companies desire with regards to net neutrality.
JOE	By placing your personal interests ahead of the public's you are doing irrevocable harm to our nation.
JOE	For a nation that claims to be all about opportunity for the poor we will be rendered hypocrites, taking away the chance for people to start  up their own businesses online.
JOE	The internet will load so much more slowly for any site that isn't paying cable companies that consumers will be less likely to visit any site that isn't being paid for.
JOE	It is inconceivable that you believe  that ending net neutrality would be a positive change for anyone besides major corporations.You are selling out the public good to line your pockets.
JOE	Once net neutrality is ended by the FCC, it will be nigh impossible to revisit the issue.
JOE	Your actions will have hugely negative repercussions for decades.
JOE	I doubt what I'm saying will have much impact on you, but you should be ashamed of what you are doing.

JOE	Mark Bartleman 1984 Del Mar Ave Laguna Beach, CA 92651 US
JOE	Dear Mr.Wheeler,      Recently I have read a few articles regarding net neutrality.
JOE	As far as I understand, the FCC plans on changing it's regulations which could potentially end net neutrality, causing not only a drastic change in the way we use the internet, but potentially a drastic uproar from the millions of internet users in the United States.
JOE	I understand that these changes are good in theory, and the FCC probably believes that these changes could create healthy competition in the digital markets, but I feel as though the FCC has failed to realize the potential, and almost certain, negative affects that could come from these changes in regulations.
JOE	Sadly, internet service providers are very scares in many parts of the country.
JOE	Many regions are limited to only one provider.
JOE	If these internet providers were able to discriminate against certain online services the consumers could do absolutely nothing about it.
JOE	I feel like the changes proposed by the FCC could potentially benefit the internet, and create  healthy competition in the future, but at the moment there are simply not enough ISP options to allow ISPs the right to discriminate, which also violates the 14th amendment of the Constitution since the Supreme Court has ruled in the past that corporations should be treated as people.
JOE	Richard Rasmussen
JOE	I am dismayed that the FCC is considering new rules to allow preferential treatment of Internet traffic by broadband providers.
JOE	No aspect of this rule benefits the public, and it will add another barrier to entry for growing tech companies.
JOE	The only beneficiary of such a rule would be Internet service providers, who could sell faster access to their subscriber base.
JOE	I hope you will reconsider adopting this rule, which would reduce the usability of the net and damage an important  sector of economic growth.

JOE	Tom, A free an open internet is something very important to me.
JOE	Like most other young people, i use many internet services every day, and new services come and go at a faster and faster pace.
JOE	Allowing a 'tiered' internet allows the large players (like Comcast) to extort companies that are providing content to customers on their services.
JOE	Comcast (and other internet providers) tell us that they offer us a download speed; they shouldn't be able to choose what content gets downloaded on the highway just as a freeway isn't able to choose whether a Kia or Ferrari has the right of way.
JOE	By giving priority- paid - access to those who can afford it, it eliminates the abilities of small companies, or organizations to compete with larger companies.
JOE	What if an open education platform like Khan Academy is given the slow lane to media providers because media providers have the funds to pay for that?
JOE	How is that in the interest of society and the consumer instead of the corporation?
JOE	Sure, maintaining and expanding  the "internet freeways" is expensive, but when consumers see innovative solutions like Google Fiber or T-Mobile disrupting an industry that has failed to innovate, and are protected by laws and technicalities, and watch the Comcasts and Timewarners quickly be lowering  prices and increasing speeds at no additional cost to customers, it leaves a bad feeling that these companies are solely motivated by profit.

JOE	My name is Thomas Dowdy.
JOE	I wrote to you just yesterday concerning your saddening decision to stifle the free market through your refusal to support net neutrality.
JOE	Now again I write you because, again you have released statements that are saddening and disappointing.
JOE	In your statement you say that critics of your proposed policy are "flat-out wrong.
JOE	" You go on to say that "behavior that harms consumers or competition will not be permitted.
JOE	" How then can you say that your policies will stand?
JOE	You say that service providers will be required to have a competitive baseline bandwidth.
JOE	Then tell me, exactly how competitive can any such "baseline" be if it is even a fraction slower than the fastest available to all?
JOE	How can there be an even play field when you are intentional setting it off-balance?
JOE	And who  is to decide what an appropriate baseline is?
JOE	The FCC, an agency who is renting out the ability to  bend the rules?
JOE	I once again repeat, this affront to the free market will not go unnoticed nor unpunished.
JOE	I have already stated that I will not support any politician who supports this unfair policy, but now know that since you have refused to recognized the error of your decisions, this zeal will now extend to any politician who supports you.

JOE	Hello Mr. Wheeler, My name is Dillon Goff.
JOE	I would, on behalf of my family and myself, like to formally announce our support of net neutrality, as well as our full support of any and all legislation and legislative efforts towards making net neutrality a reality.
JOE	The very idea that a utility as vital as internet access could be governed and limited by the whims of a private company (whose sole purpose of existence is to profit) is, to be frank, offensive.
JOE	One wouldn't expect a water main or power line to be limited to certain institutions because an excess fee wasn't paid, so why should the same even be considered for internet access?
JOE	It would seem that ISP's and the FCC are still living in a world where internet access is a luxury, something only to be used for entertainment by the privileged.
JOE	This is obviously not the world we live in.
JOE	So, in summation, my family and I directly and openly oppose any legislation allowing ISP's to limit and suppress certain internet actions.

JOE	Mr Wheeler, I am writing to you today as I have been following multiple news sources covering the recent FCC policies and stances on internet neutrality of data, and am disappointed (to put it politely) to find a radical shift in ideas from your agency.
JOE	In  previous months, the FCC has had the stance of protecting net-neutrality, to prevent ISPs from being able to determine which content has priority in terms of bandwidth and availability through the internet to customers.
JOE	Now we are told that you have decided to REVERSE this decision and completely destroy any sort of actual neutrality, and have decided to give even MORE POWER to the ISPs, at a loss to the consumers and users of the wonderful technology that is the internet.
JOE	This is disgraceful that you have done what appears to be deception to the american public, in choosing to side with major corporations, rather than protecting the internet as it was intended: to be a equal access medium for data and ideas.
JOE	As a PUBLIC SERVANT, I plead for you to reconsider this course of action and think of the american public, as well as the world at large, which look to the US as a leader of policy (considering how the US is the main contributor to the existence of the internet).
JOE	Don't sell out to the Internet Provider monopolies, and think of the costs that the country will have to bear if we remove all protections for the users for equal access to data.
JOE	I thank you for reading this email, and hope that you understand the potential gravity of you and your agency's decisions.

JOE	Mr. Wheeler, I am a software engineer and avid advocate of a free and open internet.
JOE	I am writing today to urge you to do everything in your power the internet stays i as open as possible to both businesses and consumers.
JOE	The ISPs who want to break down net neutrality have never had the best interests of the consumer in mind.
JOE	They have stifled progress across the country.
JOE	The state of broadband int he US is deplorable compared to most of Europe and Southeast Asia, where consumers enjoy faster, more reliable internet at a lower price point.
JOE	In addition, the ability to effectively charge an EXTRA toll to get reliable access to customers will stifle the creation of new businesses and jobs repaint on the internet.
JOE	Every company with an online presence already pays for their access.
JOE	The only reason that ISPs like Comcast want to charge them again is because they don't feel like they aren't making enough money, you just have to look at their customer service records to see that nothing will change.
JOE	The major ISPs have already stolen billions of dollars in subsidies from American taxpayers by not laying out fiber across the country at all, even after we paid for it.
JOE	Don't let them steal from our online businesses too.
JOE	Don't let the ISPs destroy the most powerful tool for collaboration, innovation, and free speech the world has ever seen.
JOE	-Tom McDermott
JOE	Dear Tom, I recently read that the FCC plans to allow "fast lanes" within the internet, allowing certain companies to pay to receive additional speed.
JOE	This is a gateway to destroying the freedom of the internet, and it is disgusting to allow large corporate  entities to control what was until now the ultimate vehicle for free market capitalism.
JOE	I know that you used to work as a lobbyist for the cable companies, just as former FCC commissioner Meredith Baker went from being FCC commissioner to Senior VP of Comcast's Government Affairs.
JOE	I know you are likely being well paid, either directly or with a job offer sometime in the future, to favor the outcome the cable companies desire with regards to net neutrality.
JOE	By placing your personal interests ahead of the public's you are doing irrevocable harm to our nation.
JOE	For a nation that claims to be all about opportunity for the poor we will be rendered hypocrites, taking away the chance for people to start  up their own businesses online.
JOE	The internet will load so much more slowly for any site that isn't paying cable companies that consumers will be less likely to visit any site that isn't being paid for.
JOE	It is inconceivable that you believe  that ending net neutrality would be a positive change for anyone besides major corporations.You are selling out the public good to line your pockets.
JOE	Once net neutrality is ended by the FCC, it will be nigh impossible to revisit the issue.
JOE	Your actions will have hugely negative repercussions for decades.
JOE	I doubt what I'm saying will have much impact on you, but you should be ashamed of what you are doing.
JOE	Edit: Thanks for the gold.
JOE	Though I don't think that there's much chance that my email will have a substantial impact, I also don't want to be one of the ones who does nothing and later cries about how we let the good old days of online freedom pass by.
JOE	I want to try to fight, even if I can only fight money with words.
JOE	And who knows, if we give up before  even trying to fight then we'll never know if we could have been successful.
JOE	Mr. Wheeler, I am writing because I would like to voice my concerns over the the FCC proposing a new rule allowing companies to pay for faster lanes for sending video and other content to their customers.
JOE	I fear what companies like Comcast and Time Warner, soon to be one company, will start doing to the sites that cannot afford to pay these giant companies so that their customers can watch HD video or play games online or connect through web chats.
JOE	I am a online student about to graduate who plays video games online and has no cable or satellite TV so I have streaming video service accounts.
JOE	I no that I am no longer part of a small percentage of people that live like this.
JOE	This decision could have dramatically negative effects on those of us that consume the internet in this way.
JOE	There is no parity between the internet  providers and the speeds and prices that they provide.
JOE	This is something that needs to be address as well.
JOE	The internet need to become a public utility in America.
JOE	As an online student I require access to the internet.
JOE	this is an expense i have  to have just like my auto insurance or electric bill.
JOE	Please consider my words and I hope others take the time to speak out about this as well.

JOE	Dear Sir, Allowing Internet service provides to charges corporations and other companies different rates for faster connections is ultimately cheating all of us, the American people, access to a net neutrality.
JOE	Rather than force Internet companies to pay premiums, the FCC is decided to ALLOW them to pay premiums to receive preferences.
JOE	Nice.
JOE	How is that really going to protect access?
JOE	Eventually everyone will have to pay the premium  or have their product squeezed out in the REGULAR service which will be degraded every year.
JOE	Meanwhile, in Brazil they have passed an Internet Bill of Rights and Europe is looking to do the same.
JOE	The people do NOT support your move.

JOE	Dear Tom Wheeler Please don't give the giant ISPs what they want by killing net neutrality.
JOE	The United States is already behind the rest of the world in terms of internet speeds and reliability.
JOE	These companies show no interest in improving their services or charging less.
JOE	This is purely to bleed customers for more money and to prevent new companies from threatening their interests.

JOE	Supposed to protect the people, so protect us.

JOE	the negative outcome of allowing companies like at&t or Comcast to essentially toll internet connections that have already been paid for by their own customers.
JOE	I'm sure you can see the problem we, as consumers might have with that.
JOE	Sure you might say, " if they do anything bad, we'll catch them.
JOE	" but ask yourself, in reality, what power does that give the consumer in situation where too often the choices are dismally minimal, and blatantly overpriced.
JOE	I urge you to come out strongly against such behavior.
JOE	As an employee of a major internet carrier I stand to gain substantially from any new revenue streams my company is able to secure.
JOE	However I could never feel good from my short term profits, of  they come at the expense of the free and open internet.

JOE	Ladies and Gentlemen of the FCC, I wish to express my categorical opposition to the proposal you put forward today regarding new rules allowing ISPs to create special access lanes in their Internet bandwidth for entities willing to pay for them, and to the very concepts underlying the imposition of a \u201ccommercially reasonable manner\u201d of action as the standard of business conduct for these providers.
JOE	Your time is valuable and I won\u2019t waste it acquainting you with the many arguments against the course you\u2019ve outlined;  I expect as public servants you have familiarized yourselves with them already.
JOE	Instead I will merely lend my voice in complete support of the net neutrality principle, as an Internet entrepreneur and digital media executive who thoroughly understands the nature of the decisions you face and the arguments on both sides.
JOE	My company delivers an educational  online game experience to millions of children worldwide through AnimalJam.com<http://AnimalJam.com>.
JOE	Please, I implore you, abandon this course.
JOE	America has suffered enough due to the hegemony of the loudest voices calling upon you to unshackle them in the name of free enterprise.
JOE	Their stewardship of our country\u2019s internet infrastructure and publicly owned airwaves for the last several decades amply demonstrate bad faith and a fundamental unwillingness to prioritize public interest.
JOE	You, on the other hand, are charged with putting the public interest first.
JOE	I respectfully ask that you stand your posts and  discharge that duty now.

JOE	To allow companies to charge more for allowing certain data through is a slippery slope and is not something that an open government should allow.
JOE	To allow for certain organizations and companies to act as gatekeepers over what we can or can not see destroys much of what makes the internet great.
JOE	The wonderful equality of the internet is one of the great things in our world today.
JOE	To allow these companies to charge different rates for different internet traffic destroys that equality and says "only those people who are able to pay will be allowed to participate in internet as future.
JOE	" We can not allow this... please support an open internet.

JOE	I just wanted to add my name to the list of those opposed to the end of net neutrality.

And that I think destroys one of the best things about the internet\u2014which is  that there is this incredible equality there.
JOE	" If internet providers are able to change bandwidth speed/allotment based on what it charges the website manager/creator, it will ultimately lead to increased costs to consumers.
JOE	Therefore, the "best" internet would be only available willing to those willing to pay for it.
JOE	This would exacerbate the wealth gap in this country even further.
JOE	I will not pretend that this is purely an ideological argument; I simply do not want to pay more for a service I already have due  to simple greed on the part of corporations like Comcast or Time Warner Cable.

JOE	Mr Wheeler, The new FCC open internet rules, as you are well aware, now allow ISPs such mine (Comcast), to charge services I use for reliable access to me.
JOE	My question around this issue is this?
JOE	How do these rules promote a more reliable Internet?
JOE	I am currently signed up for a data plan that allows a 25 Mb/s connection to the Internet.
JOE	Ideally, if that data is sent to me at less than 25 Mb/s, I should receive that data at the speed sent.
JOE	If it's sent faster, I could understand it being slowed down because I'm not paying for that level of service.
JOE	My current understanding of this matter is though that if my data, or data sent to me, has not been, let's say, insured for lack of a better term, and someone else has requested data that has been insured, and there is not enough bandwidth available, my data will be delayed/dropped despite my paying for access to it.
JOE	Please correct me if I'm wrong.
JOE	If I'm not,  how is this right?
JOE	Thanks, Anthony Howell II
JOE	Please don't let the internet die a slow painful death.
JOE	Net neutrality is extremely important.
JOE	What the ISP are going to do is wrong.
JOE	Please do what you can to stop it.

JOE	"I am a strong supporter of net neutrality," Obama said then.

JOE	Net Neutrality is important.
JOE	Mr. Wheeler, I am writing to let you know that the recent decisions about net neutrality are absolutely NOT OK.

JOE	Dear FCC, I am writing to oppose rules that will allow for discrimination on the Internet - where the wealthy can purchase faster Internet service and everyone else continues to have slower service.
JOE	I do not want telecom giants and wealthy Internet companies to determine the future of the Internet.
JOE	I want new ideas to flourish on the Internet and not be blocked because they do not have sufficient funds to purchase fast service and compete.
JOE	I do not want the Internet to be turned into another vehicle that allows money to flow from working Americans to the wealthiest -- where web-based services like Netflix purchase faster service and pass the costs on to consumers.
JOE	The proposal being considered would kill rather than protect Net Neutrality and allow rampant discrimination online.
JOE	The Internet should be viewed as a public good and should be operated consistent with our rights to Freedom of Speech and Freedom of the Press.
JOE	Turning the Internet into a pay to play scheme is unacceptable.
JOE	-- Diane Ray redbird462001@yahoo.com
JOE	Dear Mr. Wheeler, I just wanted to voice my concerns about your policy announcement yesterday.
JOE	Although you\u2019ve seemed to backtrack a bit today on exactly what the proposal would entail, the end result of the is still clear: there will be discrimination between different types of internet traffic.
JOE	No matter how small the \u201ccommercially reasonable\u201d fee may be, the troubling  factor is that any fee at all is going to stifle innovation and ultimately be bad for the end consumer.
JOE	The even scarier part is, we both know how government bureaucracy works - an open ended phrase like \u201ccommercially reasonable\u201d ends up getting turned into granular details that ultimately favor the companies who lobby the government and pay to put people like yourself in office.
JOE	I\u2019d like to take one excerpt from the public statement made today as an example: "After all, a prioritized connection for a heart monitor may be a good thing at home without harming anyone else.\u201d Sure, in theory that sounds great!
JOE	However,  these are the scenarios that pop up in my head immediately after reading this statement: 1.
JOE	What\u2019s to stop there being a tiered system for heart monitors, one in which those with good health insurance plans or enough money to pay for the \u201cpremium heart rate monitor traffic\u201d?
JOE	2.
JOE	What if a new startup company develops a new heart monitor that\u2019s revolutionary?
JOE	a.
JOE	Without the capital up front, how can they make their product into the homes of those who need it without being able to pay the cable companies the big bucks to make sure their product works as it should?
JOE	b.
JOE	What if they develop a compression algorithm that makes the \u201cpriority pipe\u201d necessity for that traffic unnecessary?
JOE	It\u2019s still traffic of that particular type and thus will still be subject to additional fees if the cable companies see fit.
JOE	Overall - the picture that has only begun to be painted from this announcement is already scary.
JOE	It will only get scarier when lobbyists and big business get their hands on it.
JOE	Do the right thing for the citizens of this country.
JOE	We do not need to be protected from Janet Jackson\u2019s \u201cnip slip,\u201d we need protection from the corporations who are trying to take over the internet, something that we all know is just as necessary as phone lines are and should be treated as such (like a necessity, not a commodity).
JOE	Thank you for your time and I hope you have the courage to stand up and fight for what you already know is right.

JOE	Peter Schuck of Yale Law School has argued that the FCC is subject to capture by the media industries' leaders and therefore reinforce the operation of corporate cartels in a form of "corporate socialism" that serves to "regressively tax consumers, impoverish small firms, inhibit new entry, stifle innovation, and diminish consumer choice".
JOE	[39] The FCC selectively granted communications licenses to some radio and television stations in a process that excludes other citizens and little stations from having access to the public.
JOE	[40] Michael K. Powell, who served on the FCC for eight years and was chairman for four, was appointed president and chief executive officer of the National Cable & Telecommunications  Association, a lobby group.
JOE	As of April 25, 2011, he will be the chief lobbyist and the industry's liaison with Congress, the White House, the FCC and other federal agencies.
JOE	Meredith Attwell Baker was one of the FCC commissioners who approved a controversial merger between NBC Universal and Comcast.
JOE	Four months later, she announced her resignation from the FCC to join Comcast's Washington, D.C. lobbying office.
JOE	[42] Legally, she is prevented from lobbying anyone at the FCC for two years and an agreement made by Comcast with the FCC as a condition of approving the merger will ban her from lobbying any executive branch agency for life.
JOE	Nonetheless, Craig Aaron, of Free Press, who opposed the merger, complained that "the complete capture of government by industry barely raises any eyebrows" and said public policy would continue to suffer from the "continuously revolving door at the FCC".
JOE	Mr. Wheeler, I am writing in regards to today's news that the FCC intends to allow for Internet service providers to sell "fast lanes" to content providers.
JOE	I would like to voice my strongest displeasure with this decision.
JOE	Creating an open, free, and equal internet is one of America's greatest achievements, and set a precedent that has been followed by all free nations throughout the world.
JOE	Today, you upset this balance, handing the keys to the most important and powerful invention of the last half-century over to already-successful businesses who increasingly operate like oligarchic regional monopolies.
JOE	I cannot understand the rationale for this decision, other than idiocy, a sickening lack of spine, or simple corruption.
JOE	It is  simply bad business.
JOE	The highest profile (American) companies in the world today: Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon etc, have all achieved success from humble origins precisely because the people who preceded you in your position had enough foresight to understand that, in our capitalist system, an equal playing field is necessary to spur future growth.
JOE	Your decision won't kill these companies, but it will kill the possibility of new ones who lack the resources required to pay to be favored by ISP providers.
JOE	It might kill Netflix, for example, because of the price increase  it will have to pass on to it's subscribers- the same subscribers who pay for it precisely because it allows them a way to watch television programs, without needing to pay for the exorbitant fees the cable companies want for their "programming bundles.
JOE	" In other words, you force people's money back into the arms of the very same folks who were trying to get away from them.
JOE	Coincidence?
JOE	I bet not.
JOE	Besides being awful capitalist policy, this decision paves the way for the censorship of the internet- we are not china, so the government won't censor content- so instead, Verizon/Comcast will just simply remove specific content that they find offensive.
JOE	God knows what that will be.
JOE	I won't see it, so I guess I'll never know.
JOE	Your office will claim that this is not the case, that it's an overreaction, but I am no longer buying it.
JOE	You have lost all credibility in regarding this.
JOE	All that aside, you just sold your country.
JOE	You know it, I know it, but what you don't know is that for what it's worth, you have just lost the Democratic party my vote until someone reverses it's policy of being for the corporate interest in every notable instance, or I die.
JOE	I will no longer vote for the people who are doing their damnedest to turn this country into an oligarchy, and I am probably too late to change anything, but I will have no further part in it.
JOE	-Cyan Perry
JOE	What's the deal Tom?
JOE	Internet Service Providers ARE utility companies.
JOE	It's time the FCC got out of the stone ages and realized just as much as "telephony" is a utility, so is internet!

JOE	Dear Mr. Wheeler, The news that has come out today around your new proposed rules on net neutrality are both startling and shocking, to say the least.
JOE	The idea that the internet should be segregated, and allow private corporations to gate content and pick- and-choose what they serve and whom they serve goes against the very principles that the open internet was founded on.
JOE	I am an aspiring digital entrepreneur, and am working tirelessly with my co-founder and my team to bring our new product to market this year.
JOE	However, with this announcement, I have little hope that the barriers to entry will be low enough for us to make an impact and difference in the world thanks to the open internet.
JOE	We have small budgets, we cannot afford to pay the big-boy prices for access to the internet economy like Google, Netflix, and other entities.
JOE	This is a complete and total barrier to our ability to create and share with the world.
JOE	If these rules were in place in 1995 we would not have things such as Facebook, Google, Apple Computers, or even Microsoft.
JOE	Everything in our new digital era is founded on the shoulders of giants that started as David\u2019s before they became Goliath\u2019s.
JOE	While the world may be flat, the internet is not.
JOE	These kinds of barriers will only bring budding entrepreneurs their knees as they would now be forced to play the game by the rules of Verizon, or Comcast.
JOE	I cannot even imagine an America where this becomes a necessity and not a risk.
JOE	No doubt you\u2019ll be receiving many responses to your new proposed rules, and it\u2019s likely my own response will go unheard.
JOE	However, myself and many other who live our lives in the digital space will be working tirelessly to make sure  that this never happens.
JOE	I have already contacted all of my representatives from the municipal to state to federal level to  make sure that I am heard.
JOE	I implore you to reconsider.
JOE	Thank you for your time, Matt Offers Product Manager Amarillo Segment Lead Seilevel email     matt.offers@seilevel.com<mailto:matt.offers@seilevel.com> mobile   469.667.1795 office     512.527.9952 fax         512.527.9953 requirements defined<http://requirements.seilevel.com/blog/>
JOE	Dear Tom, I recently read that the FCC plans to allow "fast lanes" within the internet, allowing certain companies to pay to receive additional speed.
JOE	This is a gateway to destroying the freedom of the internet, and it is disgusting to allow large corporate  entities to control what was until now the ultimate vehicle for free market capitalism.
JOE	I know that you used to work as a lobbyist for the cable companies, just as former FCC commissioner Meredith Baker went from being FCC commissioner to Senior VP of Comcast's Government Affairs.
JOE	I know you are likely being well paid, either directly or with a job offer sometime in the future, to favor the outcome the cable companies desire with regards to net neutrality.
JOE	By placing your personal interests ahead of the public's you are doing irrevocable harm to our nation.
JOE	For a nation that claims to be all about opportunity for the poor we will be rendered hypocrites, taking away the chance for people to start  up their own businesses online.
JOE	The internet will load so much more slowly for any site that isn't paying cable companies that consumers will be less likely to visit any site that isn't being paid for.
JOE	It is inconceivable that you believe  that ending net neutrality would be a positive change for anyone besides major corporations.You are selling out the public good to line your pockets.
JOE	Once net neutrality is ended by the FCC, it will be nigh impossible to revisit the issue.
JOE	Your actions will have hugely negative repercussions for decades.
JOE	I doubt what I'm saying will have much impact on you, but you should be ashamed of what you are doing.

JOE	Though I don't think that there's much chance that my email will have a substantial impact, I also don't want to be one of the ones who does nothing and later cries about how we let the good old days of online freedom pass by.
JOE	I want to try to fight, even if I can only fight money with words.
JOE	And who knows, if we give up before  even trying to fight then we'll never know if we could have been successful.
JOE	Dear Sir, In 2007, presidential candidate Barack Obama vowed to support net neutrality\u2014and we need to hold him to that promise.
JOE	"I am a strong supporter of net neutrality," Obama said then.
JOE	"What you've been seeing is some lobbying that says that the servers and the various portals through which you're getting information over the internet should be able to be gatekeepers and to charge different rates to different websites... And that I think destroys one of the best things about the  internet\u2014which is that there is this incredible equality there.
JOE	" Name me 1 segment of society that was originally developed "for the people" that HAS NOT morphed into "for corporations or special interests.
JOE	" The repeal of Glass-Steagall started it all.
JOE	The middle class started dying that day, a slow grim death that is yet to come.
JOE	Please protect us; the citizens who created the opportunity for these corporations to exist.
JOE	Frankly, they should all acknowledge that and strive to put customers first rather than the bottom line.
JOE	Why change the paradigm to a LESS friendly and potentially much more expensive one?
JOE	Who will support these corporations if no one has any money to do so?
JOE	Half of the United States citizens live paycheck to paycheck.
JOE	Tell me how deciding in favor of Verizon Comcast etc represents "we the people.

JOE	Dear Tom Wheeler, I am writing asking you to ensure that net neutrality stays a right of each and every citizen.
JOE	Over the last several years I have watched as the only cable company in my area repeatedly raised the prices on my internet without improving my connection or download speeds.
JOE	I am fearful that if the government does not protect smaller companies that these types of situations will continue.
JOE	I subscribe to comcast cable and have not had the best experience with them and I am fearful of data caps and small companies not being able to pay to allow me to access them.
JOE	President Barack Obama put  it well "I am a strong supporter of net neutrality," Obama said then.
JOE	"What you've been seeing is some lobbying that says that the servers and the various portals through which you're getting information over the internet should be able to be gatekeepers and to charge different rates to different websites...

JOE	The Internet has only succeeded due to its neutral nature.
JOE	The largest success stories on the network, such as Google, Netflix, Facebook, Twitter, all of which are common household names, could not have formed in a "pay to play" environment.
JOE	I understand carriers need to make money.
JOE	I work for a carrier.
JOE	However, I also understand the Internet only has value due to the services and content you can reach through it.
JOE	Neutering future companies by making it impossible for them to compete against large entrenched players means the future Internet will be a dustier, older version of the Internet we already have (because new innovation will be killed in its cradle and the result will be stagnation).
JOE	Do you want to go down in history as the people who destroyed the future potential of the Internet?
JOE	History is very unkind in its assessment of people who made short-sighted decisions, and history remembers you for a long time.
JOE	I don't think I'd want to be that guy.

JOE	"Open Internet Rules" is wrong.

JOE	The internet is not something to monopolize.

JOE	Trying so hard to "own" this is criminal and if someone honestly believes it is okay it is greed to the core.

JOE	As the IT Manager of a small business I am deeply concerned about the idea of Internet Service Providers being allowed  to throttle bandwidth and charge tolls for preferential treatment.
JOE	The business I support is a small chain of retail stores that are connected to each other over the Internet.
JOE	Our Internet connections are used to transfer business critical files, provide customers with information about our products, and perform off site backups of a very large amount of data.
JOE	These processes are absolutely critical our company and we pay a hefty fee for our Internet bandwidth, over $1000 per month.
JOE	We pay for and expect a certain level of service from our ISPs.
JOE	When we upload backup data to our off-site backup service we expect our bandwidth will not be artificially reduced by our ISP, our off site backup service's ISP, or any other network in between.
JOE	This is what we considered the agreement when we purchased this service and we expect the  FCC to hold our ISP to the static standard of service we agreed upon, not allow them to change the nature of Internet service at will.
JOE	Internet access as it is billed to and used by customers today is a utility, or "common carrier" and should be regulated as such by the FCC.
JOE	The FCC mistakenly classified it as an "Information Service" and has made no apparent effort to correct this mistake.
JOE	Internet Service Providers sell and guarantee a specified amount of bandwidth to each customer individually, exactly the  same as terrestrial phone services.
JOE	What end customers do with that bandwidth, be it email or browsing or online video  games or streaming media, is none of the Internet Service Provider's business.
JOE	Internet Service Providers have no right to limit the use of this utility by "Throttling" the bandwidth of any third-party content provider and effectively reduce the customer's quality of service below the level agreed upon between the provider and customer.
JOE	Likewise, as a utility service, ISPs should not be demanding a fee from third-party content providers for preferential treatment.
JOE	In phone terms that would be like AT&T charging a fee directly to Sprint customers who call AT&T customers for better call quality and then heavily compressing the calls of Sprint customers who do not pay the fee.
JOE	Third-party content providers already pay significantly more than the average customer because the bandwidth they require is significantly higher than the average customer.
JOE	There is also an issue of conflict of interest in this matter that has been rarely discussed.
JOE	It is well known that the major media companies have ownership or significant financial interest in the operation of most major Internet Service Providers.
JOE	These companies will effectively give their subsidiaries and/or sister companies a free ride on their networks  while third-parties will be charged extra for the privilege of reasonable quality of service.
JOE	Third-party companies that cannot afford to pay will be pushed out of business as their audience will be unwilling to accept poor service even if the fault rests with the Internet Service Provider.
JOE	The current course of the FCC will destroy all hope of proper regulation of Internet access, ruin the customer's experience and confidence in a stable Internet, and destroy the environment that allowed the amazing innovations we've seen in Internet technology over the past 20 years.
JOE	I beg you to reverse this destructive course and move to correct the mistakes of the past by reclassifying all Internet Service Providers as "common carrier" utilities.
JOE	Sean McConnell 2711 E Michigan Street Indianapolis, IN 46201 US
JOE	Mr. Wheeler, I am blown away that anyone at the FCC can think that the fast lane proposal that is part of Net Neutrality rule will be good for consumers.
JOE	The only thing that can come from this new rule would be increased costs to consumers.
JOE	Companies like Netflix, Vonage and others will be forced to raise their prices which will in turn be passed down to consumers.
JOE	As a consumer I already pay over $80 per month for what the US considers high-speed internet services.
JOE	My ISP is already paid a significant sum of money per month to pass my traffic regardless of what the traffic contains and where it  is destined.
JOE	The ISP should be a dumb pipe that treats all the traffic equally regardless of what it contains and the ISP should plan and build their network and peers accordingly based on the number of subscribers and amount of traffic they pass.
JOE	This is what a free market should be!
JOE	Ultimately allowing the ISP to charge a company like Netflix or Vonage to transport their traffic means the ISPs are getting paid twice to transport the same traffic.
JOE	Not only will Netflix and Vonage have to raise their prices due to their increased peering costs, the ISPs will also likely increase their costs as well by implementing tiered pricing plans.
JOE	This can only kill the Internet as we know it today!
JOE	Regards, Kevin Marshall
JOE	We want net neutrality.
JOE	David Lee 1205 Maritime Way Richmond 94804 US
JOE	Hi I was just saw an article saying that you're going to allow isp to charge websites so they will be allotted so much bandwidth over other websites.
JOE	I think this is a terrible idea and does more harm to us than good.
JOE	The internet is a great place of equality and its current state with net neutrality keeps everything equal on all level if we dump these idea's then we're just letting all the big isp pick and choose who has a speeder connection on their network.
JOE	The price hike to use the internet and any website would be outrageous and should not be allowed.
JOE	I hope you take your time and think on your actions sir I can only guess on how many emails you get a day on this and hope that you keep whatever sense of net neutrality intact for everyone to be able to use the internet as equals.

JOE	Hello Mr. Wheeler, I doubt you'll even read this, but in the event you do I'll keep it brief.
JOE	The internet is a hornet's nest that you don't want to rattle.
JOE	I'm sure you're getting immense pressure from ISPs to comply to their whims, but please see the bigger picture.
JOE	Throttling websites and charging extra fees will DESTROY everything good about the internet.
JOE	What makes it great is for everyone to be on equal ground and to have a voice.
JOE	Doing what you're doing will absolutely ruin that.

JOE	Dear Tom, I live in the back woods and already have to pay an arm, a leg, and a left testicle for internet, not to mention Xbox live and Netflix.
JOE	If the prices go up any father I won't be able to afford anything internet service provides.
JOE	I run a small at home craft shop and depend on the internet for my wares.
JOE	I can't go without internet.
JOE	My shop depends on it.
JOE	It's not fair  to offer a "fast lane" and require companies to pay extra for faster speeds.
JOE	Actually you do that already.
JOE	No need to add more money to that already rising cost.
JOE	I get you don't care because you have plenty of money to waste.
JOE	However, not many Americans do.
JOE	I work two jobs other than my shop and can barely make ends meet as is.
JOE	The only entertainment in my life is the internet and Netflix.
JOE	Raises those costs will force many Americans like myself to disconnect services and cause companies to lose even more money because you are greedy.
JOE	Please think about this in an average American's  point of view and realize this means forced disconnects, gamers losing the only past time they have and love, and many  companies losing money and going out of business.
JOE	With the economy the way it is now, the country can't afford to lose anymore.
JOE	The wrong decision will further exacerbate our country's inequality.
JOE	Don't put this kind of power into the hands of corporate interests that have already proven they value greed over humanity.

JOE	Dear Tom Wheeler, Please create net neutrality rules that encourage a free and open internet, not rules that stifle and inhibit it.
JOE	If the newly drafted rules are approved, not only would costs for consumers and online companies rise, but big, rich companies with the money to pay large fees to Internet service providers would be favored over small start-ups with innovative business models \u2014 stifling the birth of the next Facebook or Twitter.
JOE	Smaller companies that can\u2019t afford to pay the premium will get whatever plodding service is left for everyone else.
JOE	Listen to what the people want, not what Time Warner and Comcast want.
JOE	These monopolies should not get to dictate how the internet is shaped.
JOE	Thank you, Stephanie Markham Seattle, WA 98105
JOE	Mr. Wheeler, Last night, reports came in that the current Open Internet Proposal that is being considered by the FCC will include language that will permit the creation of a so called "Fast Lane" payment structure.
JOE	While you have since come forward  to say that this isn't true, you were distressingly vague about what is actually contained in those proposals.
JOE	As such I ask you, please release the current Proposal to the public.
JOE	You and the FCC are the organization that represent us, the American People, and our best interests, and repeatedly your representation has come up against veritable mountains of money and political pressure from the organizations that stand to directly profit from anti Net Neutrality, and who have already begun to extort large companies like Netflix into paying extra for "preferential treatment", and the permission in  doing so is a slippery slope.
JOE	Recently, the EU made motion to draft Net Neutrality into fundamental law across Europe.
JOE	The fact that America is still fighting over it is in many ways embarrassing at this point.
JOE	I urge you to reveal your current Proposal to the public, and to take steps toward making the Internet a public utility.
JOE	Thank you for your time, Andrew Seich

JOE	Dear Mr. Wheeler, With your reversal on Net Neutrality, it's unclear whether you deserve to lead the FCC.
JOE	Your job is to protect the majority, the average American, and so your reversal can only mean you or the FCC has become corrupted by money and influence from the Comcasts, Verizons, and AT&Ts of this country.
JOE	But it's not too late for you to stand up for us, you know.
JOE	History is filled with men who chose to do good despite the hardships.
JOE	You can kill the fast lane and classify internet service providers as common carriers like they should have been classified a decade ago.
JOE	You have the power to fix the errors of those who came before you.
JOE	Or you can obey the lobbyists, ride out the calls for your resignation from people you were chosen to protect, and history will not remember you.
JOE	You have a decision in this, which is more than the rest of us have.
JOE	Mr Wheeler, I am writing to you asking you to reconsider your current position about the upcoming rules related to net neutrality.
JOE	This goes far beyond just netflix, this affects consumers and the purchasing power of people.
JOE	These actions will tip the scale even more favoring those who can afford the effects of the new rules you are trying to implement.
JOE	Not all of us are  rich, so please reconsider your position on these new rules, because otherwise it will seem that you are more interested in the well being of corporations rather the citizens of this country.
JOE	Thank you for your time, and I hope you read this email and rethink your position.

JOE	Dear Chairman Wheeler and the Federal Communications Commission, Net neutrality is a key component of the way the internet functions currently.
JOE	It allows for an open forum (relatively) uncensored and unpolluted by corporate interests.
JOE	Equal access to all content is at the heart of net neutrality, and must be preserved at all costs.
JOE	To allow corporations to pay more for consumers to have easier access to their content is one of a slew of ways in which the US government is not a democracy, but a government fueled by money, a plutocracy, or any other term you might prefer.
JOE	You must retain and support net neutrality to allow for open communication for the future of America.
JOE	It is an obscene infringment upon our personal rights to be spied upon willy nilly by the government (and its corporate partners).
JOE	But to be given only a certain subset of 'approved' or 'paid for' content AND have surveillance puts the US awfully close to being a totalitarian state, the very opposite of what the US was founded as.
JOE	Support net neutrality, and help to restore democracy to the US.

JOE	Dear Chairperson Wheeler, I believe from my personal experience with Comcast here in Savannah GA that allowing ISPs to also be content sellers (via their cable television services in this case) is a disservice to the American people.
JOE	I also believe supporting the Comcast buyout of Time Warner will make the situation worse for me as a consumer.
JOE	In my case, Comcast has offered me access to the internet with and without having it packaged with their television cable service here in Savannah.If I purchase my internet access by itself, the rate per month is substantially higher than the rate for a "package" the includes (very) basic local cable TV access.
JOE	I do not want or need their cable television access, nor do I appreciate having to pay for it.
JOE	My choice, in this market in which they have an effective monopoly, is to take the package deal or just disconnect from the internet.
JOE	I am happy with the reception I get with my antenna from local broadcast channels.
JOE	I get full HD where it is broadcast in HD, and I get all of the sub-channels of the local stations as well.
JOE	I do not get this Quality of Service from Comcast basic cable - it is low resolution and does not include sub-channels.
JOE	In St Petersburg FL I also have an internet connection, through "WOW" (Wide Open West), which is (relatively) a much smaller ISP.
JOE	They charge me a flat rate for fast internet access which is substantially lower that what I am forced to pay in Savannah.
JOE	WOW does NOT sell cable television access nor access to special content they control or generate.
JOE	Their pricing is simple and transparent.
JOE	AND they have competition in the St Petersburg area which keeps pricing under  control.
JOE	I find it hard to believe that making Comcast larger will improve my access or costs for internet access here in Savannah.
JOE	That, to me, is not a reasonable expectation.

JOE	Hi Tom, Internet "fast lanes" disincentivizes internet service providers from upgrading America's internet infrastructure.
JOE	America is already far behind other countries in terms of internet speed availability (even in dense urban areas).
JOE	Letting  short term solutions like internet "fast lanes" further delay the availability of fast (gigabit end user connection) internet infrastructure is morally wrong.
JOE	Soon internet providers like Comcast, AT&T, Time Warner, and Verizon will have to promise gigabit speeds to consumers to compete with services like Google Fiber.
JOE	Once they are promising these speeds to end users, these internet "fast lane" rules will be obsolete;  "fast lanes" would imply the internet service providers will not be meeting their promise to customers to deliver the gigabit speeds.
JOE	- Justin

JOE	To Tom Wheeler: Please do not kill net-neutrality.
JOE	Please reclassify the internet.
JOE	Net-neutrality is necessary for free, democratic expression and the free exchange of ideas in the internet age.
JOE	It would be  both naive, blatantly incorrect, and dishonest to deny that.
JOE	Net neutrality is crucial to the democracy that the United States Government claims to be.
JOE	Those claims ring ever more hollow as the days pass and government agents (many with disgustingly obvious conflicts of interest and abject lack of objectivity) like yourself continue to make decisions such as these.
JOE	Charging companies like Netflix more to stream video is only the beginning.
JOE	This decision will inevitably  lead to corrupt giants like Comcast\u2014who with their impending merger will be growing even more outsized than they are now after having acquired NBC Universal, an obvious violation of anti-trust law that should never have been allowed\u2014stifling criticism and competition.
JOE	There is virtually no competition and so people will have no choice but to purchase internet access from censorious monopolies.
JOE	Asserting that competition and criticism will not be stifled by overpowered behemoths like Comcast and Verizon as a result of going down this path defies reason.
JOE	Businesses cannot be trusted to regulate their own behavior.
JOE	They have shown time and time again to be unable to resist their greedy, short-sighted, and destructive natures, taking every opportunity to abuse their customers and the American people.
JOE	If they can get away with it, they will do it.
JOE	Killing net neutrality is a danger to innovation.
JOE	If net neutrality dies, then we will enter a new age of stagnation, an age in which powerful and wealthy interests can snuff out innovative ventures that they dislike or by which they feel threatened, an age in which progress has been shackled to cinder blocks and tossed in the river by the corrupt, an age in which amoral\u2014immoral, even\u2014companies and powerful interests can block off, amputate the reach of, or just plain muzzle competition and information that runs contrary to their selfish and greedy desires.
JOE	As hyperbolic as that sounds, that is exactly what will happen.
JOE	I\u2019m currently working towards becoming a coder and a decision like this will all but assure that I become nothing more than a cog in an increasingly rusty and outdated machine instead of a force for innovation.
JOE	Maybe I\u2019ll come up with the next big thing, maybe not.
JOE	But it will likely be the latter if you continue down this path.
JOE	That or I will simply have no choice but to go to a country that rewards innovation instead of entrenched interests that will do anything to protect their power\u2014even if that selfish stifling of opposition and competition is contrary to the ideals of capitalism.
JOE	Killing net neutrality will push innovation and people like me either out of the country (brain drain) or into jobs that contribute nothing to progress (brain-dead).
JOE	How will the U.S. be able to compete globally?
JOE	(We won\u2019t.
JOE	) Without net neutrality, income inequality will only further grow and calcify.
JOE	The rich can pay for priority while the rest of us languish in the jammed slums of the internet.
JOE	Throttling innovators who can\u2019t pay and rewarding wealthy reactionaries not only harms start-ups and other such ventures, but it harms consumers who are already paying through the nose for the internet (far more for far less, even compared to poorer, developing countries) and, as a result of going down this dangerous path, will have to pay even more for access to even less.
JOE	In what way would destroying net neutrality not harm the consumer?
JOE	The answer is this: it would unquestioningly and unequivocally be harmful to the consumer and to the people of the United States.
JOE	Any institution that fancies itself capitalist or democratic cannot reasonably or in good conscience allow this to happen.
JOE	Like it or not, the internet has become an integral part of modern life every bit as necessary (moreso, I believe) than telephones, for example.
JOE	In the United States, how are most people required to apply for jobs?
JOE	On the Internet.
JOE	How is most news and knowledge disseminated?
JOE	Through the Internet.
JOE	How is much of the maintenance of social circles and contacts\u2014maintenance that many employers now require of their employees and prospective employees\u2014conducted?
JOE	Through the Internet.
JOE	I could go on, but the rule of threes makes for a prettier argument so I\u2019ll let you fill in the rest of the (very long) list of the ways in which the Internet has become a necessity\u2014a telecommunications utility\u2014in modern life.
JOE	Please reverse this course of action and reclassify the internet.
JOE	Or resign to make way for someone who was not previously a lobbyist for these very entities you are tasked with regulating.
JOE	Sincerely, Sarah Moen

JOE	The US has always been a beacon for freedom of personal expression, but we are increasingly falling behind even emerging nations on these issues.

JOE	Dear Tom, I recently read that the FCC plans to allow "fast lanes" within the internet, allowing certain companies to pay to receive additional speed.
JOE	This is a gateway to destroying the freedom of the internet, and it is reprehensible to allow massive corporations to control what was - until now - the ultimate vehicle for free market capitalism.
JOE	I know that you used to work as a lobbyist for the cable companies, just as former FCC commissioner Meredith Baker went from being FCC commissioner to Senior VP of Comcast's Government Affairs.
JOE	I'm sure that, like Meredith Baker, you're being well compensated - with future employment if not outright capital - to favor the outcome the cable companies desire with regards to net neutrality.
JOE	In doing this, you are placing your personal interests ahead of what's best for the public you ostensibly protect, and you are doing irrevocable harm to our nation.
JOE	For a nation that claims to be all about opportunity for the poor we will be rendered hypocrites.
JOE	With the FCC abolishing Net Neutrality, you will be eliminating the opportunity for people to start their own small businesses that utilize the internet.
JOE	The internet will load so much more slowly for any site that isn't paying cable companies, meaning consumers will be less likely to visit any site that isn't being paid for.
JOE	As a small business owner, one that relies utterly on the internet, I can't overstate this enough, nor can I overstate how frightening and disturbing this is to me.
JOE	How long before my potential clients simply skip my site because I haven't paid  a premium to be put in the "fast lane"?
JOE	It is absolutely incomprehensible that you genuinely believe that ending Net Neutrality would be a positive change for anyone besides major corporations.
JOE	Tom, you, along with Meredith Baker and others, are selling out the public good to line your pockets, and the pockets of  telcoms like Comcast, et al.
JOE	Once Net Neutrality is eliminated by the FCC, you, Meredith, and others, it will be nigh impossible to revisit the issue.
JOE	Your actions will have hugely negative repercussions for decades.
JOE	I doubt what I'm saying will have much impact on you or anyone else, but you should be ashamed of what you are doing.
JOE	I truly wish you'd take more seriously your responsibility to the country, and people, that put you where you are.
JOE	// Ryan Flynn
JOE	Mr. Wheeler-     I am writing to express my dismay at how little the FCC has done to protect net neutrality.
JOE	At a time when ISP consolidation is raising the serious specter of monopoly, and pay-to-play deals are catching headlines, the FCC needs to step in and be a much needed supporter of the people, not the already overly-powerful service providers.
JOE	As a web designer, it is a must that I have access to fast internet, yet my neighborhood has exactly 1 option for broadband.
JOE	This option costs more, and provides slower service than comparable services in most other industrialized countries<http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24528383>.
JOE	It seems clear that without meaningful competition in the market, or regulation as a utility, these issues will continue to get worse as the internet comes to be controlled by fewer and fewer gate-keepers.
JOE	It is shameful that the nation that has had the greatest part in creating the free and open internet has allowed powerful  moneyed interests to hijack a free service that modern Americans are absolutely dependent on.
JOE	As the head of the FCC, you have the power to make that change, if only you have the bravery and integrity to counteract the sway of Comcast and their ilk.
JOE	Best regards,                        Erik Rath

JOE	Mr. Wheeler, Please support a neutral Internet.

JOE	More and more, we are delivering information to lifelong learners using the internet.
JOE	We aren\u2019t just using ebooks and electronic journals.
JOE	We also have educational videos, audio, and a plethora of other multimedia resources.
JOE	Without a neutral net, we do not have neutral information.

JOE	Net neutrality is now one of the largest issues facing our nation and how it communicates.

JOE	Hi Mr. Wheeler, In light of these worrisome reports about your organization's stance on Net Neutrality in the upcoming Open Internet Rules, I wanted to write in to tell you that allowing mega-corporations like Time Warner and Comcast to restrict or overcharge various services is unacceptable in the eyes of the American people.
JOE	These companies are already pushing the bounds of what should be considered "ethical" in regards to business practices against their customers, which they are able to do only by just skirting the definition of a monopoly, but if you stand to be counted with them then it can be viewed as nothing other than your support of their despicable behavior.
JOE	I want to tell you from the standpoint of one of their customers that no matter what lies or data they've fed you to convince the FCC that they won't use the destruction of Net Neutrality as a way to further gouge money from their customers, that they will in fact use it for just that purpose.
JOE	Many of us throughout the country are left with only one option for internet services, which gives the ISP total power to do whatever they wish with rates and services.
JOE	Abolishing Net Neutrality would only cause the expanse of that power into the realm of totalitarianism.
JOE	Please think deeply about you and your organization's stance on this subject.
JOE	You can either stand aside and allow them  to press down the boot harder on our wallets, or stand with us and finally let these companies know that they've taken enough.
JOE	Please make the right choice.
JOE	Sincerely, Pete Dupon
JOE	Hello Mr. Wheeler, I'm writing to you today in regards to the FCC's recent actions regarding Net Neutrality and the Comcast/TWC merger.
JOE	My name is Peter Brown and I am a young tech entrepreneur based in Washington DC.
JOE	My professional background is in email and website development for both large established brands and smaller socially-focused organizations.
JOE	The recent reports about the FCC's stance on allowing the Comcast/TWC merger and allowing ISPs to charge content providers extra fees for "fast lane" access is unacceptable.
JOE	I live in a suburb of DC that is fortunate enough to have access to Verizon Fios, but were I in a Comcast/TWC only area, I would be faced with higher internet fees, slower services and data caps that would render my professional career impossible without incurring exorbitant fees, just for doing my basic job.
JOE	As a web developer, my job frequently requires sharing large files, streaming media and immediate internet access to my coworkers and clients.
JOE	The fees I would incur for going over data caps under Comcast would dissolve any monetary profit at my current rates, and would further pass those fees onto my clients, most of whom are small organizations with tight budgets themselves.
JOE	Speaking for myself, you can see the impact of this simple trickle affect.
JOE	Scaling it up to a medium or large business scenario, with multiple employees, would be devastating for a business.
JOE	The head of Verizon has also gone on record saying he would like to impose similar data caps and bandwidth throttling as Comcast.
JOE	Unless you and the FCC act to preserve an open and fair internet, tech centers, and their employees will move, either to cheaper more available areas of the US or out of the country.
JOE	I have moved for work and am ready to move again.
JOE	This is the nature of working in the tech industry.
JOE	Please help preserve the US' position as a tech leader in the world and preserve an open and fair internet.
JOE	Thank you, Peter Brown "I am a strong supporter of net neutrality... What you've been seeing is some lobbying that says that the servers and the various portals through which you're getting information over the internet should be able to be gatekeepers and to charge different rates to different websites... And that I think destroys one of the best things about the internet\u2014which is  that there is this incredible equality there.
JOE	" -President Barack Obama
JOE	If you sell out Net Neutrality you will be undermining the future of open digital commerce in the US.
JOE	This will have serious ramifications to the open market.
JOE	I really can't believe you are considering this given the FCC's previous stance on this issue, clearly demonstrating they understand the concerns I described above.
JOE	Do not sell out our future, please understand what is ultimately at stake here.
JOE	Regards, Mike Darrah Mike Darrah 208 Hudson St Apt 2 Ithaca, NY 14850

JOE	I was deeply disappointed to hear that the Federal Communications Commission is planning on implementing rule changes that would allow Internet service providers to pay for special, faster lanes to deliver their content.
JOE	In an environment where large corporations can pay for faster service, start-ups and every day Internet users won't be able to compete and we will lose the open, free-flowing exchange of information that has made the Internet so dynamic and integral to our lives.
JOE	The FCC can ensure it has the tools to act by reclassifying broadband as a telecommunications service.
JOE	I urge you to reject the new rules and to take this vital and common sense step toward protecting net neutrality.

JOE	We want action for democratic media, not platitudes as smokescreens for corporate domination of the Internet.
JOE	We want  net neutrality.
JOE	Please guarantee that the internet remains open and available to ALL.
JOE	Thank you very much, Andrew Hecker Andrew Hecker 8717 Wickersham St San Antonio, TX 78254 US
JOE	We want net neutrality.
JOE	Please listen to us.
JOE	This will come to affect us all negatively if the Internet is a place one has to "Pay to Play".
JOE	Thank you for taking this into consideration.

JOE	Mr. Wheeler; My name is Kelsey Lang (Austin, TX), and I am writing to you about some alarming news that came out of the FCC's recently posted new guidelines.
JOE	In it, it says that the FCC would allow internet providers to create a "fast lane" in which companies can pay for better connections.
JOE	This goes against net neutrality, a theory that has been fundamentally understood as a positive and necessary aspect of internet connectivity for many years now.
JOE	To replace it with what equals to an all-out cash bid would go against the spirit of the internet as a free space in which ideas can be shared without prejudice.
JOE	A "fast lane" would promote not only certain products and services over others simply for how much money said service or product can pay internet providers, but also allow extremist groups (whether religious, racial, or political) to control what the people are seeing since the average user will abandon one site that does not load nearly as quickly as another.
JOE	While certain websites and providers belong to certain country, the internet itself is made up of no single country, and as such, the FCC should not allow those who provide access to it to put something they truly do not own up for sale.
JOE	I know that, soon after papers like the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal reported on this, you and surely your team wrote a blog post that denied this; however, the wording was so bureaucratic that it is almost impossible to determine not only your stance but also what exactly you were denying.
JOE	If you truly believe in net neutrality, then please  word your response better and take a stronger stance.
JOE	I believe that companies have a place in America and should in some ways have a voice, but over my short lifetime they have acquired too much power, and their money now runs Washington instead of our elected leaders.
JOE	If something is not done about this, both political parties will someday collapse, and America will not be the country it currently is or ever was.
JOE	Someone must stand up for something free of corporate corruption, and you're currently that person.
JOE	I don't personally know you and I most likely never will, but I must go on good faith and think that, before acquiring any wealth and power, you must have been like me who only wants what's best for those around you.
JOE	And net neutrality certainly is that.
JOE	Thank you very much for your or your staff's time, Kelsey Lang
JOE	Why are you giving more money to Comcast and others and taking it away from small business?
JOE	This move hurts democracy, hurts small business and hurts the American people.
JOE	Please explain to me how ending net neutrality helps actual Americans - REAL Americans, not corporate entities.

JOE	Jack Cravener (crav0467@kettering.edu) writes: Dear Tom, I recently read that the FCC plans to allow "fast lanes" within the internet, allowing certain companies to pay to receive additional speed.
JOE	This is a gateway to destroying the freedom of the internet, and it is disgusting to allow large corporate  entities to control what was until now the ultimate vehicle for free market capitalism.
JOE	I know that you used to work as a lobbyist for the cable companies, just as former FCC commissioner Meredith Baker went from being FCC commissioner to Senior VP of Comcast's Government Affairs.
JOE	I know you are likely being well paid, either directly or with a job offer sometime in the future, to favor the outcome the cable companies desire with regards to net neutrality.
JOE	By placing your personal interests ahead of the public's you are doing irrevocable harm to our nation.
JOE	For a nation that claims to be all about opportunity for the poor we will be rendered hypocrites, taking away the chance for people to start  up their own businesses online.
JOE	The internet will load so much more slowly for any site that isn't paying cable companies that consumers will be less likely to visit any site that isn't being paid for.
JOE	It is inconceivable that you believe  that ending net neutrality would be a positive change for anyone besides major corporations.You are selling out the public good to line your pockets.
JOE	Once net neutrality is ended by the FCC, it will be nigh impossible to revisit the issue.
JOE	Your actions will have hugely negative repercussions for decades.
JOE	I doubt what I'm saying will have much impact on you, but you should be ashamed of what you are doing.
JOE	It honestly makes me feel sick knowing that this sort of thing ever crossed the mind of someone who should be an ethically-minded person, interested in the public good.
JOE	The notion that a single check, a nice dinner and the promise of more money to come, can make you willingly destroy everything that makes the internet valuable makes me sick to my stomach.

JOE	I have spent my adult life, professionally, socially, and artistically on the internet (starting onlin in 1986, receiving PhD in Computer Science from CMU in 1997, multiple startups in the SF Bay Area, and running a large art project ElectricSheep.org, and now working in finance in NYC).
JOE	Continuing and accelerating innovation is very important to me and I have seen first hand how it works.
JOE	These days the internet is not important just to techies doing research and making companies but to the general public and especially their ability to communicate and organize democratically.
JOE	The best way to guarantee that is to categorize ISPs as utilities.

JOE	Stop this Internet thing you are doing.
JOE	You won't win.
JOE	We are more.
JOE	Dear Chairman Wheeler: I was disappointed to learn that the FCC was planning to abandon the policy of net neutrality regarding the sale and use of internet bandwidth.
JOE	I run a small book-publishing company (16 employees) in Seattle, and the transfer of large files to authors, designers, and printers is key to our business.
