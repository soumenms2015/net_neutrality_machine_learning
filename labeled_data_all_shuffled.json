As an Internet user, net neutrality\nis vitally important to me. The FCC should use its Title II authority to protect it.\nMost Americans have only one choice for truly high speed Internet: their local cable\ncompany. This is a political failure, and it is an embarrassment. America deserves \ncompetition and choice.\nWithout net neutrality, a bad situation gets even worse. These ISPs will now be able\nto manipulate our Internet experience by speeding up some services and slowing down \nothers. That kills choice, diversity, and quality.\nIt also causes tremendous economic harm. If ISPs can speed up favored services and \nslow others, new businesses will no longer be able to rely on a level playing field.\nWhen ISPs can slow your site and destroy your business at will, how can any startup \nattract investors?\nMy friends, family, and I use the Internet for conversation and fun, but also for \nwork and business. When you let ISPs mess with our Internet experience, you are \nattacking our social lives, our entertainment, and our economic well being. We won'tstand for it.\nISPs are opposing Title II so that they can destroy the FCC's net neutrality rules in court. This is the same trick they pulled last time. Please, let's not be fooled again.

As an Internet user, net neutrality\nis vitally important to me. The FCC should use its Title II authority to protect it.\nMost Americans have only one choice for truly high speed Internet: their local cable\ncompany. This is a political failure, and it is an embarrassment. America deserves \ncompetition and choice.\nWithout net neutrality, a bad situation gets even worse. These ISPs will now be able\nto manipulate our Internet experience by speeding up some services and slowing down \nothers. That kills choice, diversity, and quality.\nIt also causes tremendous economic harm. If ISPs can speed up favored services and \nslow others, new businesses will no longer be able to rely on a level playing field.\nWhen ISPs can slow your site and destroy your business at will, how can any startup \nattract investors?\nMy friends, family, and I use the Internet for conversation and fun, but also for \nwork and business. When you let ISPs mess with our Internet experience, you are \nattacking our social lives, our entertainment, and our economic well being. We won'tstand for it.\nISPs are opposing Title II so that they can destroy the FCC's net neutrality rules in court. This is the same trick they pulled last time. Please, let's not be fooled again.

As an Internet user, net neutrality\nis vitally important to me. The FCC should use its Title II authority to protect it.\nMost Americans have only one choice for truly high speed Internet: their local cable\ncompany. This is a political failure, and it is an embarrassment. America deserves \ncompetition and choice.\nWithout net neutrality, a bad situation gets even worse. These ISPs will now be able\nto manipulate our Internet experience by speeding up some services and slowing down \nothers. That kills choice, diversity, and quality.\nIt also causes tremendous economic harm. If ISPs can speed up favored services and \nslow others, new businesses will no longer be able to rely on a level playing field.\nWhen ISPs can slow your site and destroy your business at will, how can any startup \nattract investors?\nMy friends, family, and I use the Internet for conversation and fun, but also for \nwork and business. When you let ISPs mess with our Internet experience, you are \nattacking our social lives, our entertainment, and our economic well being. We won'tstand for it.\nISPs are opposing Title II so that they can destroy the FCC's net neutrality rules in court. This is the same trick they pulled last time. Please, let's not be fooled again. Title II is the strong, legally sound way to enforce net neutrality. Use it.",

Net neutrality only helps \nlarge companies. \nPlease halt all progress on the proposal to end net neutrality, immediately!\nYou are not listening to the will of the people or the voices of those technology \ncompanies who truly understand what a terrible idea you proposal is to the Internet \nas we know it, rather than the corporate interests of the only people who stand to \nbenefit from this awful proposal, the ISPs who would make more money by charging for\nthe so called \"fast lane\".\nThis proposal is in direct conflict with 3 of the stated goals of the FCC's \nstrategic initiatives:\n\"All Americans should have affordable access to robust and reliable broadband \nproducts and services. Regulatory policies must promote technological neutrality, \ncompetition, investment, and innovation to ensure that broadband service providers \nhave sufficient incentives to develop and offer such products and services.\"\n\"Competition in the provision of communication services, both domestically and \noverseas, supports the Nation's economy. The competitive framework for \ncommunications services should foster innovation and offer consumers reliable, \nmeaningful choice in affordable services.\"\n\"The Nation's media regulations must promote competition and diversity and \nfacilitate the transition to digital modes of delivery.\"If you do not halt this proposal and maintain net neutrality, I ask for you to step down from your position and resign and will demand your resignation to my elected representatives. This proposal is a slap to the face of everything good and wonderful that has been brought about in the modern technological and connected society thanks to the Internet, and a complete sell out to the corporate interests of the few, whom you used to lobby for.In fact, if a fair and honest world, you should not have ever been nominated to yourposition in the first place, given your background in corporate servitude to the companies you are now charged with regulating, as this is a HUGE conflict of interest.Sincerely,\nC.

People work their fingers to the bone to come to this country in part \nbecause we have the freedom to express ourselves as we wish and to have our voices \nheard, for better or worse. When the government bends to the pressure of business \nentities, whose only goal is to make as much money as possible with whatever damage \nthe government will support or ignore, that government diminishes the freedoms of \nits people. \nBy destroying \"net neutrality\", the FCC will diminish the capacity for new organizations to gain momentum. Ideas such as the \"Scout\" by Scanadu, a private company - which has put the power of physical examination in the hand of the layman and gives them better communication with their primary care provider - may never be allowed to flourish and improve the quality of living and the technological diversity of entire sectors of the market. Diminishing net neutrality will reduce the heterogeneity of one of the greatest constructs of human kind. No longer will the diminutive yet brilliant minds of so many small innovators be allowed their expression to be heard. No longer will true, individual talent be brought into the spotlight. People's content may not go viral. Their ideas may not be allowed to flourish. Fewer Americans will become successful entrepreneurs, entertainers and educators. \nThe purpose of the government is to look out for the interests of the people. The many, not the few. When a government prioritizes big business over its people - those who fund its every move - that government fails in its purpose. \nIf this is ever read by another being, I want them to do everything in their power to dissuade the FCC from this treacherous course of action. Keep the internet free and open to all who exercise their right to expression.\nThank you.\nSincerely,\nJoseph",

It has grown exponentially, fueled innovation and altered how we communicate\nand do business.  Network neutrality is the guiding principle that has allowed for these advancements.\nNow, large, for-profit interests want to violate the principle of network neutrality in order to increase their own profit\nmargins and create an unfair advantage to small business.\nIn case you haven't noticed, small business is the backbone of our economy.  Please do not destroy the free and open\nculture of the web.\nI strongly urge you and your colleagues in Congress to support robust net neutrality legislation that prohibits network\noperators from blocking, impeding or interfering with any lawful Internet traffic or prioritizing any content or services.\n--\nArtie Moskowitz\nartiemosk@gmail.com<mailto:artiemosk@gmail.com>",

        "text": "As a resident of a rural area and the head strategist for a technology company, I am\ndeeply concerned about the de facto monopoly/duopoly power that ISPs wield in most \nareas, particularly rural ones. We are already seeing states and the federal \ngovernment reduce requirements for telecom utilities to provide basic phone access \nin rural areas. If the FCC fails to make clear that ISPs are telecommunications \nservice providers under Title II of the Communications Act, we will continue to see \nISPs steadily increasing their rent-taking behavior as de facto monopolists, \nincluding lobbying against municipal broadband, imposing bandwidth caps, neglecting \ntheir infrastructure, and throttling traffic from vendors who fail to pay what are \nessentially kickbacks.\n        \nMy worry is that this behavior will result in residents of my area and other rural \nareas being left behind in terms of lack of broadband options, decreased access to \njobs that require high-throughput broadband, and decreased attractiveness to \nentrepreneurs looking for good locations to found companies. From my perspective as \nan IT strategist, I am concerned that we will face increasingly high fees for \nincreasingly worse service from our ISPs and those that service our customers; \nmoreover, our ability to hire the best employees will be constrained by the need for\nthose employees to reside in shrinking zones in which they can find an acceptable \nbroadband provider. The US is being left behind the rest of the world in broadband penetration - the FCC has an opportunity here to call a spade a spade and classify ISPs as telecom services under Title II as they should have been from the beginning.",

When people who already wield power are given \nmore power, what do they do? Do they decide to use their power in the best interest \nof the people? Some do, like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet.  The problem is that I \nhave trouble listing more than these two, and there are definitely more than two \nrich people on the planet.  The moral of the story is that people with power almost \nALWAYS abuse this power for personal gain.  If you strike down net neutrality, then \nyou're trusting the single least trustworthy caste with even more power than they \nalready have.  WHEN HAS THIS EVER WORKED.  OPEN A HISTORY BOOK FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.  These laissez-faire policies sound great on paper but they're almost always bad for the people.  If you strike down the last bastion of decency and freedom, the internet, then you've proven whose side you're on.  Is that fancy dinner or nice carreally worth betraying the principles of freedom and equality? Will you be able to sleep at night knowing you had the chance to save democracy and instead sold us all out? Sold out a 17 year old kid going into college who was raised on the internet?

When you let ISPs mess with our Internet experience, you are \nattacking our social lives, our entertainment, and our economic well being. We won'tstand for it.\nISPs are opposing Title II so that they can destroy the FCC's net neutrality rules in court. This is the same trick they pulled last time. Please, let's not be fooled again.

As an Internet user, net neutrality\nis vitally important to me. The FCC should use its Title II authority to protect it.\nMost Americans have only one choice for truly high speed Internet: their local cable\ncompany. This is a political failure, and it is an embarrassment. America deserves \ncompetition and choice.\nWithout net neutrality, a bad situation gets even worse. These ISPs will now be able\nto manipulate our Internet experience by speeding up some services and slowing down \nothers. That kills choice, diversity, and quality.\nIt also causes tremendous economic harm. If ISPs can speed up favored services and \nslow others, new businesses will no longer be able to rely on a level playing field.\nWhen ISPs can slow your site and destroy your business at will, how can any startup \nattract investors?\nMy friends, family, and I use the Internet for conversation and fun, but also for \nwork and business. When you let ISPs mess with our Internet experience, you are \nattacking our social lives, our entertainment, and our economic well being. We won'tstand for it.\nISPs are opposing Title II so that they can destroy the FCC's net neutrality rules in court. This is the same trick they pulled last time. Please, let's not be fooled again. Title II is the strong, legally sound way to enforce net neutrality. Use it.",

This is a political failure, and it is an embarrassment. America deserves \ncompetition and choice.\nWithout net neutrality, a bad situation gets even worse. These ISPs will now be able\nto manipulate our Internet experience by speeding up some services and slowing down \nothers. That kills choice, diversity, and quality.\nIt also causes tremendous economic harm.

When you let ISPs mess with our Internet experience, you are \nattacking our social lives, our entertainment, and our economic well being. We won'tstand for it.\nISPs are opposing Title II so that they can destroy the FCC's net neutrality rules in court. This is the same trick they pulled last time. Please, let's not be fooled again.

Limiting the ways people can interact on the internet, by \nway of monetary power, is a means of segregating people based on wallet-size. \nMoreover, it limits the amount of innovation that can be achieved through the \ninternet.\nConsider if net neutrality were not in existence in the early years of the internet.\nYou're a man named Larry Page, and you and your friend, Sergey Brin have the crazy idea of letting people search the internet for relevant tags, rather than having to find new websites by chance. This is the story of Google, which I'm sure, dear reader, you've used more than once in your lifetime. Google didn't monetize until later in its lifecycle, through sponsored links and their AdSense utility. Had net neutrality not been in place, Google may not have seen the light of day, and become the powerhouse it is today.\nIn short, if you do away with net neutrality, you do away with opportunity, the opportunity for people to innovate, create, and make the internet better for everyone that uses it, not just those with enough spending power to access certain websites reliably. The future of the internet is in your hands, and I fear we stand to lose what was once a good thing if the proper action is not taken.\nSincerely,\nJohn Gerritzen",

When you let ISPs mess with our Internet experience, you are \nattacking our social lives, our entertainment, and our economic well being. We won'tstand for it.\nISPs are opposing Title II so that they can destroy the FCC's net neutrality rules in court. This is the same trick they pulled last time. Please, let's not be fooled again.

As an Internet user, net neutrality\nis vitally important to me. The FCC should use its Title II authority to protect it.\nMost Americans have only one choice for truly high speed Internet: their local cable\ncompany. This is a political failure, and it is an embarrassment. America deserves \ncompetition and choice.\nWithout net neutrality, a bad situation gets even worse. These ISPs will now be able\nto manipulate our Internet experience by speeding up some services and slowing down \nothers. That kills choice, diversity, and quality.\nIt also causes tremendous economic harm. If ISPs can speed up favored services and \nslow others, new businesses will no longer be able to rely on a level playing field.\nWhen ISPs can slow your site and destroy your business at will, how can any startup \nattract investors?\nMy friends, family, and I use the Internet for conversation and fun, but also for \nwork and business. When you let ISPs mess with our Internet experience, you are \nattacking our social lives, our entertainment, and our economic well being. We won'tstand for it.\nISPs are opposing Title II so that they can destroy the FCC's net neutrality rules in court. This is the same trick they pulled last time. Please, let's not be fooled again.

As far as I understand, the FCC plans on changing it's\nregulations which could potentially end net neutrality, causing not only a drastic change in the way we use the internet,\nbut potentially a drastic uproar from the millions of internet users in the United States. I understand that these changes\nare good in theory, and the FCC probably believes that these changes could create healthy competition in the digital\nmarkets, but I feel as though the FCC has failed to realize the potential, and almost certain, negative affects that could\ncome from these changes in regulations.\n     Sadly, internet service providers are very scares in many parts of the country. Many regions are limited to only one\nprovider. If these internet providers were able to discriminate against certain online services the consumers could do\nabsolutely nothing about it. I feel like the changes proposed by the FCC could potentially benefit the internet, and create\n healthy competition in the future, but at the moment there are simply not enough ISP options to allow ISPs the right to\ndiscriminate, which also violates the 14th amendment of the Constitution since the Supreme Court has ruled in the past\nthat corporations should be treated as people.",

As an Internet user, net neutrality\nis vitally important to me. The FCC should use its Title II authority to protect it.\nMost Americans have only one choice for truly high speed Internet: their local cable\ncompany. This is a political failure, and it is an embarrassment. America deserves \ncompetition and choice.\nWithout net neutrality, a bad situation gets even worse. These ISPs will now be able\nto manipulate our Internet experience by speeding up some services and slowing down \nothers. That kills choice, diversity, and quality.\nIt also causes tremendous economic harm. If ISPs can speed up favored services and \nslow others, new businesses will no longer be able to rely on a level playing field.\nWhen ISPs can slow your site and destroy your business at will, how can any startup \nattract investors?\nMy friends, family, and I use the Internet for conversation and fun, but also for \nwork and business. When you let ISPs mess with our Internet experience, you are \nattacking our social lives, our entertainment, and our economic well being. We won'tstand for it.\nISPs are opposing Title II so that they can destroy the FCC's net neutrality rules in court. This is the same trick they pulled last time. Please, let's not be fooled again. Title II is the strong, legally sound way to enforce net neutrality. Use it.",

This is a political failure, and it is an embarrassment. America deserves \ncompetition and choice.\nWithout net neutrality, a bad situation gets even worse. These ISPs will now be able\nto manipulate our Internet experience by speeding up some services and slowing down \nothers. That kills choice, diversity, and quality.\nIt also causes tremendous economic harm. If ISPs can speed up favored services and \nslow others, new businesses will no longer be able to rely on a level playing field.\nWhen ISPs can slow your site and destroy your business at will, how can any startup \nattract investors?\nMy friends, family, and I use the Internet for conversation and fun, but also for \nwork and business. When you let ISPs mess with our Internet experience, you are \nattacking our social lives, our entertainment, and our economic well being. We won'tstand for it.\nISPs are opposing Title II so that they can destroy the FCC's net neutrality rules in court. This is the same trick they pulled last time. Please, let's not be fooled again.

This is a political failure, and it is an embarrassment. America deserves \ncompetition and choice.\nWithout net neutrality, a bad situation gets even worse.

When you let ISPs mess with our Internet experience, you are \nattacking our social lives, our entertainment, and our economic well being.

        "text": "Honorable FCC Commission Members,\nThank you for this open comment period.\nAs an entrepreneur with a small ecommerce business in a market dominated by giants, \na future world under a priority paid bandwidth system would likely force the closure\nof my business.  More likely, I never would have started it.\nI ask you to think not in terms of ?blocking? access, or ?bifurcating? the \nmarketplace, but rather in terms of all the myriad implications the advantage of \nspeed itself offers.  It?s about much more than how long it takes to download a \nmovie, it?s also the ability to make known that any content supported by multimedia \neven exists, even for ordinary commerce categories.\nWe live in a search engine-driven world.  All content is accessed via search.  While\nsearch algorithms are confidential trade secrets, it?s widely believed that download\nspeed is a critical signal that search engines like Google use in determining the \nrank order for results.  Google?s interest is having satisfied users who trust the \nlinks, and if immediacy of gratification is part of that user satisfaction equation,\nthen Google will weigh it in ranking organic results.\nTherefore innovative startups challenging established giants would effectively have a double burden ? not just the burden of requiring users to be more patient for identical content, also the burden of having to overcome a search rank handicap.  Between the two, the long term burden of the search rank handicap may actually be far greater and more difficult to overcome, effectively stifling innovation even in commodity industries.   \nAs an example, my ecommerce website offers custom-made home furnishings.  having rich photography and an engaging presentation is vital in building consumer trust for an expensive purchase.  In a world of priority payments, giant furniture chains with deep pockets can make their pages richer, and/or deliver them faster, and as a direct result they will consistently rank higher on search results, and thereby havean enormous competitive advantage.  Even if I have a higher quality offering at a lower price, it will be significantly harder for me to just reach the marketplace inthe sense that consumers who click on a link above mine will see or know of my link?s existence. \nSearch experts affirm it?s impossible to overstate the far-reaching implications of even a small speed advantage.  \nTherefore, the core of this issue is not about bifurcation of the marketplace, but the formidable barriers to competitive entry and therefore innovation that even a small speed advantage brings.\nIt?s hard to imagine a fairness doctrine that justifies such an imbalanced system onthe basis of ability to pay for access to the marketplace itself.  It?s harder to imagine where we?d be tomorrow without the innovative startups of yesterday who enjoyed the benefit of an open marketplace to achieve their greatness of today, (talkin?bout you, netflix!).  \nSome may say the night sky would be just as grand with only a few stars of super brightness, collectively shining with the same luminocity.  I suggest the night sky is unspeakably more wonderous, more enchanting, more inviting, more mysterious, moreinspiring, more harmonious, and ultimately better for humankind now and in the future with infinite variability.  \nThank you again for allowing this open comment period for this critical matter that may very well determine the survival of the innovation economy itself, the engine ofAmerican prosperity for generations.\nRespectfully, \n\nEvan Saks\nNeedham, MA",

As an Internet user, net neutrality\nis vitally important to me.

This is a political failure, and it is an embarrassment. America deserves \ncompetition and choice.\nWithout net neutrality, a bad situation gets even worse. These ISPs will now be able\nto manipulate our Internet experience by speeding up some services and slowing down \nothers. That kills choice, diversity, and quality.\nIt also causes tremendous economic harm. If ISPs can speed up favored services and \nslow others, new businesses will no longer be able to rely on a level playing field.\nWhen ISPs can slow your site and destroy your business at will, how can any startup \nattract investors?\nMy friends, family, and I use the Internet for conversation and fun, but also for \nwork and business. When you let ISPs mess with our Internet experience, you are \nattacking our social lives, our entertainment, and our economic well being. We won'tstand for it.\nISPs are opposing Title II so that they can destroy the FCC's net neutrality rules in court. This is the same trick they pulled last time. Please, let's not be fooled again.

Not only is this\nimmoral and illogical, but i also believe this will end up hurting comsumers in the \nlong run, because the companies that have to pay a significant amount more just to \nstay up to par in terms of there speed will have to pass this on to the consumer, \nand therefore raise rates tremendously.

Such a proposal would water down consumer protections, serve\nas a slippery slope to discrimination against certain web traffic, and\nforce consumers like me to suffer higher rates and slower speeds.\nThat violates the spirit of \"net neutrality.\"\nPlease, stand up for consumers, protect net neutrality, and fight for\nthe free and open Internet.\nSincerely,\nMr. Sanjay Dhiman\n9013 W Oaks Ave\nDes Plaines, IL 60016-4247",

        "text": "I have heard about the strong desire for companies to be able to use information \nabout where a person is surfing the web, or what games they play, or what they use \ntheir internet for primarily, and allow them to have people charge for those \nservices in order to provide them better internet usage for those sites in \nparticular. However, I have increasingly strong concerns over this.\nMy first concern is the potential for abuse. What I am talking about is the \npotential that internet companies will have, once this is in place, to look at a \nsite that a person has used only once and then ask them to pay for using this site. \nThat they can go into a person's history before this ruling has been placed, look at\nevery site they have ever been to, and charge them accordingly for every site, \npotentially accruing the debt charged to an amount that the person cannot pay for. \nNot legally being able to pay for a service rendered means great financial trouble \nand potential legal proceedings against them. This does not just affect me. Please \nrealize the amount of people who go surfing the internet on Google and find sites \npertaining to information they want to find, or people who scour the web looking for\ndifferent sites that pertain to videos, products, games, etc. \nSecondly, this destroys the chances that anyone will get their website off the \nground. With people being charged to be able to access a website, people become verychoosy with who they go to. It hurts the business of these sites. YouTube would takea hard hit if people were charged to use it, Amazon would take a hard hit as people head out to find items at their local stores instead of paying, google would take a hit as people find a different way to find the information rather than having to pay. Internet companies in general would take a hit as people tried to avoid using the internet as much as possible.\nThere are other concerns but I feel that this is enough...please, I would advise youto heavily reconsider this. I speak not just for myself but for the whole of the internet, do not implement this decision. It will only serve to hurt the internet, companies who provide the internet, and people who use the internet.",

I know yourself and\nthe FCC have made several attempts to clarify your actions and reassure the american people that you will keep the\ninternet open for all, but allowing preferred service in any way to any carriers will give those carriers far too much\ncontrol and power over our content. These companies already have virtual monopolies in many areas and we as\ncustomers would not even be able to \"vote with our dollar\" if we wanted internet access, which unfortunately so many\npeople rely on for enumerable reasons such as work and school. I strongly feel that these rule proposals will hurt\ninnovation, hurt consumers, and only serve to increase profits to companies that already attempt to limit of expansion of\nservices that already are laughable compared to the rest of the world.  Furthermore I wholeheartedly believe that your\nposition as chairman is in and of itself a conflict of interes\n t due to your former position as a lobbyist for Comcast. I hope you consider my and my fellow American's words which\n I know are clearly the majority and create a true open internet for the future.\nSincerely,\nNicholas Matula.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nServer protocol: HTTP/1.1\nRemote host: 192.168.199.16\nRemote IP address: 192.168.199.16",

With the\nno-unreasonable-discrimination rule vacated, an ISP can negotiate any secret deal it wishes with any or all content\nproviders (CPs) to extract payment for the use the ISP's network and there is no way for a consumer to know the details\nor even necessarily that such a deal exists.\nEven if a consumer could learn all the details of the discrimination arrangements between all ISPs and CPs, I do not\nbelieve that the ISP industry represents a viable market.  For consumers, transitioning from one ISP to another is\ndifficult or, in many cases, impossible because only a single ISP exists in their area.  Certainly one cannot choose ISP A\nfor consuming services from CP X and ISP B for consuming services from CP Y without having simply paid for the full\n suite of services from every ISP.\nI find the notion that ISPs can collect twice for the same data delivery repugnant and not in keeping with the common\nnotion that a consumer who has paid for a service to deliver data at a certain rate must now pay again (through higher\ncosts passed on by the CP) to make anything available to deliver.\nI also find compelling the argument Ryan Singel makes (https://medium.com/p/7805f8049503) that if unfair terms are\nimposed by an ISP on a CP, that the ISPs wield enough power to delay any judgment long enough to irreparably harm\nthe profitability of a CP, and that even if a judgment is rendered in the CP's favor, an appeal could result in a court again\n ruling that the FCC has overstepped its authority.\nMy recommendations are:\n*       I believe the FCC does have the authority to dictate terms more in keeping with the notion of an Open Internet and\n that the only way it can effectively exercise that authority without the courts whittling away at it or outright overturning\n it is to reclassify ISPs as common carriers.\n*       If the FCC cannot see fit to reclassify ISPs, the transparency rule should be explicitly expanded to eliminate secret\ndealing between ISPs and CPs and thus make the costs of using particular CPs visible to consumers.  Even if genuine\ncompetition is unavailable or impractical, the potential still exists for the ISPs to respond to public shaming via such\ntransparency.\nBest Regards,\nKeith Chapman\n22305 Canterfield Way\nGermantown, MD",

It has become an open source for information that \nhas changed people's lives and has given birth to great ideas and innovations. \nPlaces like Facebook, where I can stay connected with my friends and family, Amazon,\nthe place I can buy items I want, and Wikipedia, the site that has kept a compendium\nof all human knowledge. The Internet has produced amazing things and now since the \nnew Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling, I am absolutely stunned. It is \ndespicable to think that the government has been complicit in allowing a corporate, \nanti free-market, crony takeover of this great innovation that has been absolutely essential in paving the way for new technologies. It is horrendous that this administration has elected a telecommunications lobbying blowhard to run the FCC, anagency that demands absolute fairness for oversight.\nThe Internet has worked perfectly and will work perfectly if the current model of net neutrality is maintained. To clarify, the new ruling would allow telecommunications companies to charge premiums for the service that everyone is guaranteed now. It is economically unsound as it would stunt starts up and capital and ultimately stunt potential economic growth. Not only that, but information wouldbe accessible at lower quality and would give unprecedented power to what these companies believe to proper content or not. Freedom of information is a right. It's not something up for debate. People have the right to freedom of speech and expression, along with the pursuit of knowledge.\nI would like to wrap this up by invoking an old proverb: \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"  Please, don't give into these corporate crony crooks who think they know what THEY think is important. Do the right thing and keep Net Neutrality.\nSincerely,\nAhren Norbert Gutschenritter",

When you let ISPs mess with our Internet experience, you are \nattacking our social lives, our entertainment, and our economic well being. We won'tstand for it.\nISPs are opposing Title II so that they can destroy the FCC's net neutrality rules in court. This is the same trick they pulled last time. Please, let's not be fooled again.

Use it.\nAnd what this will do to me a disabled Veteran on a fixed income is a outrage, this is sheer discrimination against all the people who currently served and have served and scarified in the past, I rely on the internet as my first and primary contact with my Doctors and Pharmacy for my Medicines  on a weekly basis, and what you propose will essentially cost me more money to get the medical services that I am entitled to as a Veteran, you sir need to get off the pork/bribe ride and start doing your job as it needs to be done, fairly and honestly to serve the American people.",

It is appalling that these 5 corporations control the information that the majority of the public digests,\nas most people would most likely not take the time to seek less biased information elsewhere. This is a country in which\n corporations have had so much power through clever marketing lobbying and other forms of questionable political\ninfluence that we have managed to convince a good part of the population that a scientific FACT of climate change is\nfalse. So instead of changing the situation for the better of our future we manipulated lied to our people so that our\ninterests in oil could continue to make enormous profits.\nThis is a country in which it is so easy to tell lies to people so that our business interests will not be harmed. Another\nexample (of hundreds more), is the NRA convincing people that the Arms Trade Treaty will take away domestic\nweapons and the country's inability to pass a simple background check for acquiring weapons, which an overwhelming\nmajority of the country supported. These are the corporations and organizations that control the information we digest.\nThe internet remains our last source for sharing information without any filtration. The younger generations who grew\nup with the internet are not bound to close-minded perspectives confined to the contaminated information we receive\nfrom common news sources. The internet must remain entirely free and open and should not by any means have a\ngatekeeper with ulterior motives. If we allow corporations such as Comcast and At&t to determine the speed of the\ninformation we receive, this is one step closer to Soviet era state in which the populations no longer has no access to\nunbiased information, and there will be countless loopholes in which the ISPs can build unjust monopolies and hurt start\n up companies and competition.\nThough you may be prohibiting ISPs from slowing down internet right now, internet speeds have risen over the years.\nAnd in a few years time only those with priority access will have internet speeds that match what the standard should\nbe.\nI find it disconcerting that the person who has introduced this proposal used to lobby for those corporations. There\nseems to be an interest in this proposal for Mr. Wheeler with his ties from his previous years as a lobbyist. Despite the\ntremendous public outcry through tens of thousands of protestors, more than 100 of the nation's most important\ncompanies, and millions who have signed petitions against this proposal, your commission has voted to move forward\nwith this proposal. It is CLEAR what the country's majority stance is on this issue. There is no question that if this were\na true democracy the proposal would be off the table. I urge you to consider this and take a truly democratic approach\nwhen considering this proposal.\n I cannot quite grasp how a group of 5 people have total control over an issue that directly affects 320 million people,\nwho have no way to cast a vote other than to \"comment\" on the FCC website. But this is another issue with our so-called\n democratic system. I hope you shut down this proposal, as it would be a huge leap in the wrong direction.\nSincerely,\nAlexander Richard Williamson\nUnited States",

This rule will KILL start-up innovation and enshrine the power of\nBig Telecom, who will make the internet as awful as cable television.\nPlease protect Net neutrality to preserve an open internet and urge the FCC to assert reclassification authority of\nbroadband under title II.\nSincerely,\nShawn Duffy\n 21774",

As an Internet user, net neutrality\nis vitally important to me. The FCC should use its Title II authority to protect it.\nMost Americans have only one choice for truly high speed Internet: their local cable\ncompany. This is a political failure, and it is an embarrassment. America deserves \ncompetition and choice.\nWithout net neutrality, a bad situation gets even worse. These ISPs will now be able\nto manipulate our Internet experience by speeding up some services and slowing down \nothers. That kills choice, diversity, and quality.\nIt also causes tremendous economic harm. If ISPs can speed up favored services and \nslow others, new businesses will no longer be able to rely on a level playing field.\nWhen ISPs can slow your site and destroy your business at will, how can any startup \nattract investors?\nMy friends, family, and I use the Internet for conversation and fun, but also for \nwork and business. When you let ISPs mess with our Internet experience, you are \nattacking our social lives, our entertainment, and our economic well being. We won'tstand for it.\nISPs are opposing Title II so that they can destroy the FCC's net neutrality rules in court. This is the same trick they pulled last time. Please, let's not be fooled again. Title II is the strong, legally sound way to enforce net neutrality. Use it.",

As an Internet user, net neutrality\nis vitally important to me. The FCC should use its Title II authority to protect it.\nMost Americans have only one choice for truly high speed Internet: their local cable\ncompany. This is a political failure, and it is an embarrassment. America deserves \ncompetition and choice.\nWithout net neutrality, a bad situation gets even worse. These ISPs will now be able\nto manipulate our Internet experience by speeding up some services and slowing down \nothers. That kills choice, diversity, and quality.\nIt also causes tremendous economic harm. If ISPs can speed up favored services and \nslow others, new businesses will no longer be able to rely on a level playing field.\nWhen ISPs can slow your site and destroy your business at will, how can any startup \nattract investors?\nMy friends, family, and I use the Internet for conversation and fun, but also for \nwork and business. When you let ISPs mess with our Internet experience, you are \nattacking our social lives, our entertainment, and our economic well being. We won'tstand for it.\nISPs are opposing Title II so that they can destroy the FCC's net neutrality rules in court. This is the same trick they pulled last time. Please, let's not be fooled again.

I \nthink there is a utopia potential that has started with the share of information and\neasy-accessibility. If those things go away even slightly, or cannot be improved \nupon because of ISP-\"Gatekeepers\" looking to make an extra buck, we lose the \npotential to spread education to those who want it. \nSincerely,\nAusten Andrews",

It's clear that Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T are\ntrying to put one over on the public.\nAs the Consumerist points out, \"While the Verizons and Comcasts of the world like to pretend that they do all of the\nheavy lifting in bringing data to your home, the truth is often very different. In most cases, an ISP is only responsible for\n carrying data the 'last mile' to the end-user. There are numerous bandwidth providers who do much of the long-distance\n hauling of data.\n\"Much of the innovation and investment that the NCTA claims will be harmed by reclassification has actually been\ndone by companies much further up the stream than your ISP. Verizon is not responsible for figuring out to compress\nand stream HD Netflix videos to millions of customers at once. AT&T did not create the smartphones or tablets its\nsubscribers use. Comcast is not running multiplayer video game servers that allow players from around the world to\nsquare off in real time. ISPs are passive (and increasingly passive-aggressive) conduits through which this data is\nsupposed to travel as efficiently as possible and with no regard for its source.\"\nThe Consumerist continues, \"Allowing ISPs to decide which content gets to users the fastest \u2014 and making this\ndecision based not on the most efficient way to deliver data, but solely on who pays the most \u2014 is like handing over\nhighway exit ramps to a private toll-taking company and telling it to charge whatever it wants to drivers looking to get\non or off the Interstate.\" http://consumerist.com/2014/05/14/lets-dissect-the-cable-industrys-b-s-net-neutrality-argument/\nWe want action for democratic media, not platitudes as smokescreens for corporate domination of the Internet.

This is a political failure, and it is an embarrassment. America deserves \ncompetition and choice.\nWithout net neutrality, a bad situation gets even worse. These ISPs will now be able\nto manipulate our Internet experience by speeding up some services and slowing down \nothers. That kills choice, diversity, and quality.\nIt also causes tremendous economic harm. If ISPs can speed up favored services and \nslow others, new businesses will no longer be able to rely on a level playing field.\nWhen ISPs can slow your site and destroy your business at will, how can any startup \nattract investors?\nMy friends, family, and I use the Internet for conversation and fun, but also for \nwork and business. When you let ISPs mess with our Internet experience, you are \nattacking our social lives, our entertainment, and our economic well being. We won'tstand for it.\nISPs are opposing Title II so that they can destroy the FCC's net neutrality rules in court. This is the same trick they pulled last time. Please, let's not be fooled again.

        "text": "I am strongly concerned by the FCC's announcement to allow so called \"fast lanes\". \nThere are several problems with this proposal.\n1. Charging on both ends, effectively ignoring speeds promised to the subscriber. \nThe ISP is already charging the subscriber for a certain level of access, say 10Mbit\ndownstream. However, now the ISP wants to refuse to provide the service level that \nthey promised and charge whoever wants to send data to the subscriber again. I.e. we\nwill only send your data to the subscriber at a rate of 0.5Mbit unless you pay up. \nThey completely ignore the promise they made to the subscriber, which was to have \n10Mbit downstream.\n2. Punishing cord cutters. Cable subscriptions are insanely lucrative, but that \nmight be changing. However, this should be an isolated issue separately from \nInternet access. Sadly most ISPs are also cable providers, so now that people escape\nthe cable TV milking, they want to create a new cash cow by increasing the price of \ninternet access and monopolizing access to subscribers like they already do in Cable\nTV.\n3. Freedom to do business on the web will be over. It is effectively impossible for \na small startup without a big war chest to establish a Netflix competitor, because you won't be able to afford paying for access to the ISP's subscribers. Even if the ISPs would be open to do doing business with you, established players will lobby them to not do so. This will kill internet innovation and job creation as we know ittoday.\n4. There won't be fast lanes, there will be new slow dirt roads and the existing normal speed. When the ISPs tell you about new \"fast lanes\", what they mean is that they will selectively stop letting these links congest over capacity. What will happen is that speed increases and investment in bigger links will seize, meaning the \"normal internet\" will slowly die and be slow, congested and unreliable at all times. They won't invest in new fast lanes, they will just let everything else go un/underinvested. This will contribute to killing innovation and job creation.\n5. Consumers have no choice to escape this situation. There is no ISP competition, most ISP subscribers in the US have only one single choice. If their ISP starts letting service quality dwindle, to extort \"fast lane\" fees from companies like Netflix, they can not simply switch providers. Most consumers oppose fast lanes, butISPs will install them (just like other measures that most consumers oppose, like data caps), because they know for consumers it's either them or no internet. Further, even if a consumer has the choice of switching ISPs, the situation will look as follows. Cheap ISP A that enforces fast lanes vs sustainable ISP B that invests in his infrastructure. Most likely B will charger more, since they can't press money out of internet businesses. Now if you switch from A to B you will pay more for internet service, but you will still subsidize A by paying internet companies more money, so they can in turn pay up to ISPs like A. For example Netflixincreased their price for all subscribers worldwide, due to Comcast now pressing money for peering out of them. They did not only increase the price for Comcast subscribers. This means the pricing structure is very opaque and not clear to consumers.\nThe severity of a lack of innovation and can be easily illustrated. Remember 10 years ago, when you had to pay a fortune to call your aunt on that other continent? Due to a fast and easily accessible internet, companies like Skype could disrupt thetelephone market and drive down prices for end users dramatically and even offer free international calling for everyone. In a \"fast lane\" world, this can not happen, because the call quality will be too bad. Now keep in mind that most ISPs are also phone service providers and they would have LOVED to prevent that disruption and keep milking the consumer.\nDue to the reasons given above, I strongly oppose the establishment of fast lanes and urge the FCC to go back to its original path of promoting net neutrality withoutexceptions. I also urge the FCC to break the ISP monopoly in the United States and \n\nensure that real competition exists in all communities.",

        "text": "Net neutrality is the First Amendment of the Internet, the principle that Internet \nservice providers (ISPs) treat all data equally. As an Internet user, net neutrality\nis vitally important to me. The FCC should use its Title II authority to protect it.\nMost Americans have only one choice for truly high speed Internet: their local cable\ncompany. This is a political failure, and it is an embarrassment. America deserves \ncompetition and choice.\nWithout net neutrality, a bad situation gets even worse. These ISPs will now be able\nto manipulate our Internet experience by speeding up some services and slowing down \nothers. That kills choice, diversity, and quality.\nIt also causes tremendous economic harm. If ISPs can speed up favored services and \nslow others, new businesses will no longer be able to rely on a level playing field.\nWhen ISPs can slow your site and destroy your business at will, how can any startup \nattract investors?\nMy friends, family, and I use the Internet for conversation and fun, but also for \nwork and business. When you let ISPs mess with our Internet experience, you are \nattacking our social lives, our entertainment, and our economic well being. We won'tstand for it.\nISPs are opposing Title II so that they can destroy the FCC's net neutrality rules in court. This is the same trick they pulled last time. Please, let's not be fooled again. Title II is the strong, legally sound way to enforce net neutrality. Use it.",
